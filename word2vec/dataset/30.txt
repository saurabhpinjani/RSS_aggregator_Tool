i now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my fender amp  after i bought monster cable to hook up my pedal board i thought i would try another one and update my guitar  i had been using a high end planet waves cable that i bought in the 1980 s    once i found out the input jacks on the new monster cable didn t fit into the fender strat jack i was a little disappointed    i didn t return it and as stated i use it for the output on the pedal board  save your money    i went back to my planet waves cable   i payed $30 00 back in the eighties for the planet waves which now comes in at around $50 00  what i m getting at is you get what you pay for  i thought waves was a lot of money back in the day   but i haven t bought a guitar cable since this one   20 plus years and still working   planet waves wins 
if you are not use to using a large sustaining pedal while playing the piano  it may appear little awkward 
works for practice     it s a guitar instrument cable  what can i say     maybe not the best but it serves it s purpose 
   unbalanced guitar cable is notoriously noisy especially around florescent lights  these are no different  i would prefer to use cables with better shielding but cannot justify the expense considering how rarely these things get used 
it s a cable  no frills  tangles pretty easy and due to it s design it might rattle a little when you move around but it works like it should
one end was loose  so i tightened it  it keeps coming loose so i had to put a dab of crazy glue on the threads  hope i don t ever have to open the end for repair 
it is a decent cable  it does its job  but it leaves much to be desired as far as structural integrity is concerned  the mating part of the connector jiggles back and forth  the switch is also loose  the connector will move around 2mm out of the microphone without the switch being pressed  i would not recommend using this cable for critical applications  it would be more suited to home or hobby use 
back in the 1980 s i bought a can of deoxit not the right name but can t remember it  which worked much better and cost much less  it was made for the military  the spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high  it does work but the stuff i used to have was much better  i don t see much else out there so i may have to stick with it it is just very wasteful for the cost  i have had good luck with wd40 too  but it is very flammable  i would call it average 
i ve got an old mesa boogie that has developed scratchy controls over the years this stuff cleaned most of them out pretty well but my midrange pot is starting to crackle again i hate to tear the chassis out again but it d gotta happen
these cables are a little thin compared to hosa and gls  they picked up a little interference from other equipment as well  guessing they are lacking some shielding 
let me start by saying that i am a huge fan of dano stomp boxes   i probably own close to a dozen of from the various lines they make   this pedal does a decent job covering your tremolo needs  but imho the tremolo from dano s cool cat line is a much more durable pedal for only $4 more  at the time of this review    the switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link   i don t think it s true bypass either   the cool cat has a metal enclosure  true bypass  sturdier inputs and knobs  and a much better on off switch   the features and sound are the same   spend the extra $4 and you will have a much more bullet proof pedal with the cool cat trem 
what s to say   it s not a high end capo and for the price i can lose it   like most of the other capos i have owned    it s not a high quality capo and it does take a few adjustments to get it seated properly 
the description says the color is gold   it s not   more of a greenish yellow  but does what it is intended for   i think i would stick with the black color though 
the string work well but did not give the mellow sound on my guitar that i was looking for  the shipping was quick and the strings were recieved in good order 
doe s not stay on to well  moves to much even if you go for the pick lightly could be redeisigned 
after buying this product  i have concluded that $8 00 is a lot of money for foam  does the job  but i think the velcro job would be preferable to this one 
this is a fine guitar  but it isn t amazing   my particular instrument has some issues with the finish in a couple of places around the perimeter of the guitar   they look like black splotches underneath the sunburst paint and clear coat   there s one near the top strap post and another near the place where the pick guard mounts to the underside of the body   neither would be apparent to someone who wasn t appraising the guitar  but they are there and don t look normal to me   maybe i got the first one off the line after they switched from black painted models   my guitar also has a weird v shape on the back of the neck where the wood grain doesn t match at all   i m guessing that it s a joint that has been glued together   i know that the better les paul guitars have a one piece neck  and since i didn t read about this one having something different  i assumed it would be the same   glue is stronger than wood and les paul guitars have a tendency to break in that area  so i guess my guitar should be more durable than some  still  it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery   i m not sure that seeing these finish issues before hand would ve dissuaded me from buying the same guitar  but upon reflection it would ve been much smarter to visit a music store and examine the guitar before buying my remaining issues with the instrument have more to do with the general design of all les paul guitars versus my particular instrument   the guitar is too small for me to comfortably play it without a strap  even while sitting   the top strap peg is angled up slightly  where guitars with horns have them angled down  which means that investing in the install of a straplock system of some kind is a good idea with a les paul   the pegs just don t stay in the strap holes as well as on some other guitars   it s great that this guitar has all the knobs and switches that &#34 real&#34  les paul guitars do  but from a practical standpoint it is rather cumbersome to have separate volume and tone knobs for each pickup   the range of adjustment on the saddles is pretty small  and i found it impossible to setup the guitar for coated  09 strings without additional hardware the guitar sounds decent  it looks pretty great  although not quite as pretty as the pictured one   and due to its shorter scale length it is a tad easier to play than some other guitars   note  the shorter scale length is characteristic of les paul guitars  it doesn t indicate that this is less than a &#34 full sized&#34  guitar   though this is a fine guitar for the price  i m not sure that i would make the same choice if i were in the same position again 
good overall but pick ups are terrible   might be better replacing the pickups but i wasn t willing to spend the extra money
i got this pretty fast  i took it out of the box and wanted nothing more than to give it 5 stars just for value alone  i m still shaking my head in disbelief that i got this guitar for the price  first  the  tuner  issues that i ve been reading about  replace the strings  i stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune  a set of d addario 10 s cured that straight away  or whatever you prefer just change them   the tuners aren t the best but they are not to blame  it s the cheap strings  now  technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box  the neck angle was so off the a string rattled no matter how high i set the bridge  the guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle  yes i could have sent it back but i suspect i would have gotten another just like it  i had to spend about 6 hours shimming the neck and the nut  never had to do this to the nut on an electric  not even on a used guitar  the nut slot was cut too deep   as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable  it required 3 business cards to shim the neck which is the most i ve ever had to use  after i got that straight i removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws  in my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matter if i bought this used none of this would have been a big deal  but as i m looking at this horrid neck angle and doing all this work i m steadily staring at the  qc passed  sticker  must have been built on a friday afternoon or something     now  after i did this it is sweet    i play through a peavey valveking 100 and it rocks as good as my strat w   duncans and dimarzios  the quality of the electronics is not sub par at all  after adjusting the pickups screws to match the string height and getting all the horrible wax off them   i d argue that this is as good as any epi i ve ever played as far as pups and all  so don t hesitate there because i don t really care for epis and i m in love with it   i bought this to sell mainly  but now       the build quality  hmm  if you can do guitar work go for it  otherwise i d highly recommend a more expensive model  the $299 models are great right out of the box usually 
i got one of these a while back and being like i am with guitars took it apart to see just what it s made of mahogany ply maybe or capped with real  but it s plywood body inside kinda shocked in competitive guitar market that epi would go there   otherwise decent build  basic original lp design bolt on  surprisingly good electronics w  full size pots and open back 3 way toggle  good neck but bad tuners     note  any 45% mount tuners  meaning mount hole at 8 and 4 o clock position respectively    will fit with the bottom hole of the 2 screw junk tuners mine had   so add 10$ to get more than 30 minute in tune play here and you can fill the other little holes with nail polish like it was made right to begin with i like the style  and though there s plywood involved still good fit and finish  though many disagree it makes no real difference what electric guitar body woods are  only in looks   electric guitars don t resonate  that s why pickups are important i don t like the idea of this as beginners choice for the simple fact of cheap tuning keys you lose interest learning on something that can t hold good tuning   so that bugs me that big player choice like epi would do that it s likely they ll keep this style but revise it some    to be hardwood body and real tuners as i  think the price point demands it   otherwise a decent piece good wiring  decent pickups    but   
update  the right angle switched end started developing crackling issues and is now intermittently cutting out  i ve had it just over a month  so amazon won t help me  despite the lifetime warranty  amazon has only offered to let me pay shipping and to give me a partial refund  despite being an "authorized retailer" for planet waves  amazon does not offer exchange under the planet waves warranty beyond the standard amazon 30 day return policy  amazon support referred me to the manufacturer  i ve emailed planet waves  but the instructions for the warranty are to return it to a dealer for exchange  i don t have a dealer within 100 miles of my home  so unless the manufacturer comes through  this one is quickly becoming unusable and it looks like it might cost me to resolve it i frequently switch instruments and this makes it easy to do quietly  i ve used cables with the g&h  quiet plug  which also works well   but the switched connector on this has an advantage over the g&h   you can use it as a mute and tune with a head stock tuner without unplugging your instrument  the cable itself is a bit stiffer than i m used to  which makes coiling for storage very easy  but it can quickly become a twisted mess on stage if you more length than you really need  the little elastic cord keeper strap works better than i could ever have imagined  i ve never given the sound of a cable a thought  being a bass player who doesn t use much for effects and who plays mostly passive instruments  but using this with my genz benz shuttlemax 9 2 and fearful 15 6 1 cab  i really notice a pronounced difference in clarity and dynamics  the sound is much more alive with this over any of the other cables i have from a variety of manufacturers  hosa  proco  whirlwind  etc   i ve never had to warranty exchange a pw cable  but others tout the easy swap at any pw dealer as a great reason to buy them  i like knowing that     edit  as stated above  you will not be able to exchange it through amazon beyond 30 days   
a long time planet waves user i trusted that the circuit breaker cable would be up to their usual high standards    imho it is not the plugs are great but do not seem to have good cable grip  i like their old cables that had a long cable protector extending from the plug allowing the cable to flow gracefully from the guitar  and into the amp at the other end   the actual cable is horrible     it is a hard plastic outer shell and does not lie or flex well like a good cable should  e g  like my old planet waves cables do   they claim that the shielding is excellent but i find it to be mediocre  very disappointing purchase 
this pedal has been around for a long time  and though the overall quality has declined as boss has cut corners to enable lower priced mass production of their pedals  the boss ds 1 remains the staple image of distortion stompbox s  the ds 1 is a no frills tank of a pedal  it was designed to withstand a direct nuclear blast as well as michael moore stepping on it  so you know it can take any amount of punishment you might care to give it this pedal doesn t replicate any type of amplifier it s not a "marshall in a box  or a mesa boogie  or a vox  or a fender  from a tonal aspect it isn t complex or dynamic  it will add plenty of grind to your tone  and plenty of hum to go with it  if you re looking for your first distortion pedal to use with your 15 watt practice amp  look no further  if you have a decent tube amp  look elsewhere  because with this pedal  you get what you pay for  and it simply will not do a quality amp justice pros  inexpensive  good build quality  distorts your signal cons  lots of hum  the tone control gets really shrill really fast without the excessive hum and almost unusable tone control  this would get 4 stars 
    it s a very generic sounding distortion and is not really useful for much beyond a lead boost into an already distorted amp   the same is true of many of the pedals from this era  including the  gasp   tube screamer   the tube screamer is a great lead boost into an already distorted amp  but not too many people will tell you that it s a great stand alone distortion because it s not   same goes for the boss ds 1   now  here s where things get interesting   there are plenty of modifications that can be done to this pedal by keely  monte allums  and others  that turn this otherwise mediocre pedal into a raging beast  dripping with tone and gain that sings for weeks   for the cost of this pedal  and the $30 or so that it costs to get the materials for a mod  are well worth it   mine is modified with the monte allums tri gain rectifier modification and it s absolutely killer   i use it as a lead boost  but by itself it s a nice overdriven tone that you ll find plenty of use for   if you want a basic  solid  well built distortion pedal  this is it   but by itself the boss ds 1 is really nothing special   but as a platform for great sounding mods  you can t go wrong 
it s a good od  but i thought it would be higher output  and more articulate  just personal preference  i mean  the pedal is a classic for a reason 
bought it for using danelectro mini amp  so i don t need to worry about the battery   it works perfectly as an adaptor should be  & you won t have any surprise by its performance      two stars out because of comparing the price with the mini amp  less than $20   the adaptor is pricy  $8 50   but it still saves me $$ for the long runs 
the problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on  which produces a sound   the morley pedals have a separate on off switch  so you can turn them on or off at a given position   the difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isn t always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency   suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle  and just leave it there   you can t really do that with this pedal   it is a bit smaller than a morley wah  but in my experience  the sound is equivalent on the base models 
"oh its a crybaby"  "i have a crybaby wah"  "you suck because you don t own a crybaby"   i m tired of hearing these statements from guitarists that are so fresh they couldn t even tell you how many strings their instrument has   this wah pedal just doesn t cut it   maybe at one time  but not today  it hasn t been up to par in a long time   as a young player i insisted on having a wah pedal   my mom bought me this one   i thought it was awesome until i learned better   it took me about a week to learn how to turn it on and when i finally did i thought i broke it the eq on this pedal isn t good  there is no smooth transition from heel to toe   there is a big drop in the freq  that kills the effect   you have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop   you have to pretty much push it toe foward and then literally stomp on it to turn it on and then follow the same steps to turn it off   very inconvenient for someone who is trying to rapidly move between effects on a board   i can t say its just a complete piece of junk  it does give you a wah effect  it is a classic pedal but there is better out now so why are we still stuck in the stone age with this thing   i even had someone mod mine and while it gave it a little more headroom and fixed the dropping issue  i still had to slam on it to turn it on off and it still sounded like a cheap wah my suggestion   the mark tremonti wah is great   kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use   it may cost more  but you will probably end up hating the crybaby and getting one anyway  so just go with the tremonti power wah to begin with   what i use for wah is the digitech rp250 processor   you may say that this is a cheap processor  and it is  but i ve been using it for years and i haven t seen anyone that can tell the price of it based on the sound quality and thats what matters   why i suggest it for wah is you can control the sensitivity  how hard you have to press your toe down to turn it on  i have mine set fairly light  and you can totally shape your tone right there on the board very easily   you even have presets  crybaby being one of them   you can get an entire processor full of effects and an awesome wah for a little bit more if you want a cheap child s gimic type toy  this is for you   want to get serious about a wah   spit on every crybaby you see and go elsewhere 
it sounds good but it adds soooo much noise to my pedal board  if that s not a problem  definitely worth the price 
i acknowledge that this is a minority opinion   perhaps i just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards   but while i loved the sound and functionality of this wah wah pedal  it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable   i suspected that the potentiameter was shot  so i had that replaced  but the same problems reoccurred   like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it good product  but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit i had 
although this capo is marked as correct for a mandolin  it only works correctly above the 3rd or 4th fret on my mandolin  any lower on the fretboard than that and this capo doesn t have enough pressure to work on the 1st or 2nd fret position on my mandolin  even though my mandolin has a fairly low action i have a number of kyser capos and very much like the style  i own at least six kyser guitar capos and use them on all of my guitars from a taylor 12 string to a fender american strat without any problems   but in this case the banjo capo didn t work for what i need  perhaps the capo sent to me was defective  although i have enough decades of experience with stringed instruments to know that it didn t seem broken  just not up to the task from feedback others have sent to me it is possible this capo may work for you if you wish to take a chance on it  but i know that i don t have time while on stage to take 20 seconds to set a fussy capo  just right  to make sure it is holding just right and then hope it doesn t start to buzz on me in the middle of a song  i went with another brand after talking to some bluegrass guys who had better luck with another style of mandolin capo 
the very first thing i noticed about the design is how far from the guitar s surface the strap is actually connected   what this tells me is there is considerable added stress to the screw and the wood surrounding it because of the added leverage to the guitar s weight   the &#34 fulcrum&#34  is the surface of the wood  if this makes sense  and i can t help but wonder if it could eventually  eventually over much time and use  cause cracks or splits as a result i found someone selling only the dunlop strap buttons  which is a great idea for someone with 2 main straps and several guitars  and was about to order them when i found planet waves elliptical end pins   i think this is the best idea yet for keeping a guitar on a strap  unless you re going to be spinning the guitar around your shoulders  and no additional stress on the guitar s body   i ve ordered a set 
i agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy   i purchased a set of these strap locks years ago  and i dont recall having this issue  so i m thinking that dunlop changed the screws at some point   i was luckily able to get the screws in with some muscle  and the locks are secure   however  due to this issue  i m considering other alternatives for another guitar of mine that could use strap locks   i hope dunlop fixes this issue soon 
work very well  nice low profile  easy push button on and off but  it is true  not good for thick straps  and the gold tone ones discolor easy with minimal use 
the dunlop strap locks work pretty well  but the standard hole cut in a standard leather strap is not big enough to accomidate the locking buttons   the strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes   this for all intents and purposes means that you will not be able to use that strap with standard strap buttons ever again they do work as advertised and they are easy to take on and off for strap adjustment when required 
great guitar companies don t always make  or sell under their aegis  the best strings  i love my teles but i can t stand fender strings  likewise  i love my martin ukulele  but trying these strings for the second time  i had the same conclusion as i did the first  aquila s are far better  aquila s have a more organic feel and a fuller  richer sound  the martins begin to hold their tune sooner   aquila s take a couple of days or more   but the sound is thinner and the feel isn t nearly as friendly  the approximately 3 dollar price difference is not  for me  worth the lesser satisfaction  even on my least expensive ukes  considering how seldom one usually changes uke strings  the higher priced aquila s still seem to be worth the extra couple of bucks  use the martin s  or any cheaper string  when you are working on your uke  put the stress of repeatedly de tuning and re tuning on them  then switch to aquila s for playing  some may like the martins but few won t love the aquila s 
this is a decent pop filter  it gets the job done but it has a few flaws  it attracts a good amount of dust  the screen tends to mess up  which caused me to tear the first screen   & the goose neck tends to unwrap it s self out of place  it also gets shakey so i tend to have to screw it back in  other than that  it s a decent pop filter but not for the price  under $10 would ve been better  i should have went with something cheaper than $20  cough cough  the auphonix pop filter  cough cough  but  i will in the future 
does not stay in place well 
this gigbag is a very tight fit for my epiphone les paul  their is minimal padding  so it is little more than a dust cover  i tossed it aside  and bought a fender gigbag  the fender is heavily padded  and gives me some serious protection 
we all have different tastes in guitar picks  i know   as i wrote elsewhere  the dunlop tortex are awful for acoustic  in my opinion   these ultex are much better   not as noisy  better feel   still not my favorites   i ll have them with me for spares 
this is not a bad product  just not great   as soon as i received it  i installed it on my custom made grit laskin guitar  and played with it for over two hours   installation was fast  and only took a couple of minutes   my problems with it are 3 fold   #1   sounds just a bit "tinny" = too much on the high end  and not an equal amount of bass   #2   a small complaint is that you have to dismantle the entire installation just to change the batteries  and i couldn t get mine to work in "passive" mode   #3   and the biggest complaint  is that the volume control is difficult to get to when you re performing on stage   you have to stick your finger in the hole on the top side of the strings and fumble around trying to change the volume which is very sensitive so all of sudden you can be too loud or too soft   like i said  it is not a bad product  just not top notch  and definitely not for professionals   if you re just fooling around at home  or recording at home  it is fine  and will do the job for you   but     if you re a pro  you ll want to spend double the money and get an l  r  baggs m 80   the m 80 gives you the truest sound  unbelievable   works in passive mode  and is very easy to change the volume control   sincerely  doc
i m using them to angle my speakers up in addition to isolating them from the desk surface  unfortunately  these angle the speakers down by default  so i had to do some cutting and rearranging  but it worked out  if you need to cut these to fit your speakers  try to find something better than scissors  because it s quite hard to cut the foam evenly with them 
martin makes a variety of good sounding strings  and these are toward the light end   the sound is bright  but lacks a fullness found with some of the heavier strings such asmartin msp4150 sp phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings  light medium the custom light are easier to play and have a bright tone to them  but can make a guitar sound like a cheaper model compared to the light medium  some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics  if you strum harder  they are more stretchy and the tuning will be less consistent  changing the tone for the same reason a "bend" would  if you play at a fairly consistent sound level you can expect more of a bright sound than a resonant one on the other hand  compared to some other brands with more of a dampened sound  the brightness can make an instrument sound quite good depending on your style  these might be a good choice  if you are used to playing a solid body electric with a lighter feel to the strings that make medium strings uncomfortable  these might seem more at home   if you are used to martin medium strings  but want something that you can play for a few extra hours a day without feeling as if you are overdoing things  you might like these too  but when you pick up a guitar with the martin medium strings  you may find that even a cheaper guitar sounds better in comparison to these on a more upscale one i wouldn t say i dislike these  and i wouldn t quite say that those who gave it five stars oversold them  because they may deserve five stars for your particular needs  but as an all around choice  there are better sounding ones from martin  but it s a moot point if you don t feel comfortable playing them  make sure to read a variety of reviews before deciding because there are other equally valid viewpoints just as each player is unique 
brand name  good string  good tone  seem to last awhile but i change strings often so never really know how long a set will last 
these just don t have the right feel and the sound isn t that great compared to other materials the quality control is so so  the picks aren t cleanly cut out they are injection molded and as a result they are left with a thin trim all around them i ll stick with dunlop gator grip  96mm or prs 1 0 picks  for more flexibility or acoustic  i prefer fender medium celluloid picks 
pretty flexible due to the 0 60mm thickness  i would recommend the dunlop max grip picks over these picks   the max grips have a much better grip please click yes if my review have been helpful to you  it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews  and leave a comment if you have any questions  i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help 
since they were named &#34 gator grip&#34  i expected them to have a good gripping surface   that was not the case   the entire material and holding surface is the same material   also they weren t as large as i expected   they are still usable as decent picks 
i started doing a lot of fingerstyle guitar playing  and it seems to have made my fingertips slick   so i have a hard time holding on to picks  when i use them  on upstrokes   i m sure i could improve my technique and fix the problem  but it s more fun to blame the pick   these picks were no different from picks without the &#34 gator grip&#34  imho   but gorilla snot worked beautifully 
first  i love these picks and used them exclusively for years   i have dozens of them  they never wear out   i used to use them when playing in a loud rock band  and never had any issues   they are very comfortable  and easy to control now the bad  the sound   not the sound of the plucked not itself  but the hard plastic of the pick against the string makes a very noticeable "plinking" sound that is audible through your amp   if all you re playing is loud music  this may not be an issue   but i essentially stopped using them when i started playing in a different band with more dynamics  because during quieter passages the plinking sound of the pick on the strings is very noticeable to me so  too bad   i think these are great picks  but i d like them to be made of a softer material 
so  these picks are really nice  but the picture is not what you will get   these picks are translucent purple   other than the strange color  they are good picks   they really do help with speed and accuracy   great for mandolin playing updated  amazon has changed the image for this item  so now the picture really does show what you will get 
i dont know why they are called big stubby  they are on the small side   way to thick for me   they do sound good though and will last a long time   i feel like i am playing with a nickle  i like the indentation  helps the grip a lot  i should have paid more attention to the size and thickness  still looking for the right picks for me   if these were slimmer and a bit larger i would buy again 
looking for picks for bass   this one did not work for me  it is thick and hard  good attack but only thumb picks work  so i can use my fingers too 
the thing about picks or plectrums if you prefer is that they are really a matter of preference and once you pick one  no pun intended  you should try to stick to it and get used to it through practice   i ve used many different types of picks over the years and i ve not found the ideal one for me until recently when i decided to use a silverpick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which i find fits my needs the best and so far it s just a case of getting used to it   this particular dunlop pick is as described being fat  stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face   the hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard   this makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing   for me though  i ll keep this among my collection of picks for use but it s not my default or preferred choice for play 
the right pick is a personal preference  nothing wrong with dunlop stubby pick  but it s not for me  i bought a pack of 2 0mm  picks last year and loved them but left them in florida when i went north  i forgot the name of my favorite pick and bought these by mistake 
they work good   way to stiff and small for me though   great attack but holding onto it is the problem   the slick finish makes it kinda hard to hold onto and the small amount of pick that shows makes strumming difficult without hitting your finger on the strings   i imagine it would work great for lead players but i m a rhythm player 
they are half the size of a regular pick   bit too thick for me   sound nice  will last forever  wish i had sized them before i bought them 
i bought these and used them for a week before giving my review if amazon used half stars  i would have given them 3 5 5  i just couldn t bring myself to give them a 4 5 so i went with 3 5  here s why i ve used standard medium picks for over 20 years  switching to these was not a problem at all  sure  they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems  by far the biggest change was the &#34 pointy ness&#34  of the picks  the distinct point on the pick drastically changes the sound of your playing  especially when playing chords  everything is much more pronounced  which isn t necessarily a good thing in my opinion  it s especially bad when playing clean electric  picking notes or strumming  if someone was to ask me if these are good picks  my answer would be &#34 it depends &#34  it really does  in my opinion  it depends on what you re playing  from a rhythm standpoint  i don t like these at all   they take the warmth out of the chords because the point of the pick makes strummed chords sound too sterile to me  for lead work they are ok because you can really dig into each note and have it come through could i play faster with them  no  could i pull off amazing licks that i couldn t do with my normal picks  no i tried them  but didn t like them  maybe if you typically play a ton of lead work  constantly  these would be the way to go  i don t  and they aren t for me  i m glad i tried them  though  because i ll never wonder again if they were for me 
i ve used these for more than two years but recently shifted to its big brother  the jazz 3 xl  same thickness and feel  tone  but in a larger form factor  i would definitely recommend the xl version if rhythm+lead work is required  for strictly solo work with easy to achieve pinch harmonics  this one is better 
i bought some of these a few years ago just to try them out   the "gel" in the name sounded intriguing   these are ok  the colors are bright  but otherwise they re just standard plastic picks  which on an electric i prefer nylon because it s less "clicky" on the strings   these are fine  and if i pull one out of my gig bag i ll use it  but overall there are other styles of pick that i d buy before buying these again   nothing wrong with them  but they re just normal plastic picks  nothing special other than maybe the brightness of the colors 
i like fender mediums  always have  but  i gotta branch out man   not sure about these picks yet   the feel a little more stiff my usual   i want them to last longer   what happened to the days when you carried the same pick around in your pocket for months and played it until it was round 
i recently ordered a wide variety of picks to find the ones i liked best  these sounded different "gel" picks  i do not like them  being see through distracts me  they are a little scratchy on the edges  perhaps a more experienced guitar player would do fine with them but being at the stage where i am still looking at what i am doing   i just can t use them well 
i actually forgot that i bought the heavy and medium versions of this pick   it s not a bad pick  i will continue to use them but i wish they had a softer center  or softer coating where you grip the pick to prevent it from turning or falling out of my fingers 
if you can t find a container and add your own sponge  then buy this keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential i think this item should cost three bucks at most  and $1 50 would still yield a healthy profit i made some more from stuff from the dollar which i think are better i use this one for my baritone uke  and the bigger ones i made i use in my dreadnaughts if you make your own  just make sure to not let the sponge drip  ie  wring it out  and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood 
it s nothing special   no frills  just a simple concept that works   it s important to maintain humidity in your instrument  especially in a dry climate like west texas   the evaporation rate will depend on the amount of humidity in the air where you store your instrument so  when you first start using it  you have to be diligent to check the sponge regularly to ensure that it is still moist 
i have an electronic indoor outdoor thermometer that shows relative humidity and a whole house humidifier it is interesting to see just how quickly relative humidity changes inside and outside with that electronic thermometer the whole house humidifier pumps out about 3 gallons of water a day into a 1500 sq ft house during the fall and winter keeping the indoor humidity around 47% this makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier  makes the whole house safer for the martins now you can use a little in the case humidifier like this to help with humidity  but i think you really need a whole house solution and a monitor system a sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too  just don t get water on the wood and don t forget to take the silica gel packs out of the little accessory compartment in the case  many guitars come shipped with these and their job is to remove humidity from the case all the better acoustic guitar shops i go to have a big humidifier running in their showrooms 
i wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick  my guitar would probably not be happy without it 
a simple system for gettting humidity into the guitar  the price is just right and it is very simple to use 
we all know it s just a container with a sponge in it  no biggie  i bought it to get super saver shipping on something else and because i plan to keep an all solid acoustic guitar at a weekend place where it will sit unused for long periods of time  jamming it between the guitar strings and getting it hooked onto them feels a bit rough on the strings  but it should do the job 
i got this product to clean and condition my guitar fretboards  well duh    does it work   yes and no   first it did not appear that anything was coming out   after a bit of rubbing i did notice a &#34 slight&#34  bit of solution  turns out its mineral oil on the fretboard by the frets   i tried to spread it out with the included cloth and discovered that the cloth was useless  a paper towel would hold up better  seriously    i used an old tee shirt square and spread some of the oil around  but honestly it took me 10 to 15 mins and i noticed no difference in the appearence or the playability of the guitar   it says to use it before and after each session  thats about 30 mins of my time per guitar  i general play 2 guitars durning the course of a session    i do still use this occasionally  but i would not spend money to purchase it again   just not what i was looking for in a fret board cleaner 
i used this on a 5string bass  i liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier  my friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it her reason for her opinion is simple  this stuff puts out a lot more oil  or whatever it is  than you would think  this has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hard earned callouses soft   which when playing guitar can lead to bleeding fingers pretty fast  and did for my friend  to apply this you simply hold the handle and press down while running it along each string  one string at a time  i highly suggest you only use one slide down each string  at first it may not look like anything is getting on your strings  but give it a few minutes and you will start to see the excess oil appear and start pooling under the strings on your fretboard  that s ok  you will need to wipe away the excess  and i m telling you  if you accidentally get too much  that excess oil may not come off easily  didn t for me at least   mine left little pools of oil between the frets  and i only used one swipe and thought i had just a little on there  naturally  this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling  my friend hated that part too  and i agree with her  soft callouses = no callouses  this is a good product idea  and i like it in theory  and with my thick bass strings i didn t have the severe problem w soft fingertips that she did  just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for you it does what it says  but you may not like what else it does or how it feels on your fingers 
this works  and i really like evans  but i got 2 of these and they both looked different and looked cheap  although i have been using it for awhile now with hard use and it is holding up great and saving my kick drum head from abuse 
cheaply made and thin leather leave a lot to be desired  at least it s long enough for even the lowest slung of guitar postures  this should accomadate a bass as well due to the extra length i am comparing it to $10 guitar center straps which have double leather ends which are much sturdier than the ones on this ernie ball strap  which are thin and single ply  i wouldn t trust this strap without a strap lock 
nothing special  just like every other strap of its kind  i compared it to other poly straps i have and it s ok  no better and no worse  price was good  it took a long time to come  leather ends seem ok  i mention that because it appears to be the main complaint  i m using it as a spare so it should be ok  i m a little disappointed  i m used to a higher quality from eb products  it is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone  i don t perform a lot of antics on stage  it s just me and the axe  i don t expect any problems  hope this helps  small &#34 thumbs up&#34  to amazon 
the hole at the end where you hook it up gets worn out easily    just try and leave it on always  its cheap but it wont fail  wont drop your guitar  if you re careful 
the previous reviews are pretty accurate  though i would add that when the pignose cabinet is closed  it can often sound rather boxy  it sounded much clearer and cleaner when it was opened a couple of inches as for using pedals with it  it will take distortion to a degree  it reaches a point  if pushed too hard  at which the definition of the distortion will begin turning mushy and shrill  you can use a distortion + overdrive to decent effect  especially if you are running a cleaner sounding od like a tube screamer  i don t think it would do so well with a bad monkey  for example  though  which has more dirt in the tones it produces  i don t have a fuzz box  not yet  but have one on order   but i think most fuzzes will sound like crap unless you use a relatively cleaner  sweeter one like the red witch fuzz god or the seymour duncan tweak fuzz  otherwise  you will hear too much ground asphalt in the sound my wah wah  a morley power wah  was almost useless with it  the limited frequency response of the 5" speaker made it sound overly throaty on cleans and when i put the boost in the shrillness would show itself again a chorus pedal sounds totally sweet on it  but a phaser  in my case  a phase 90  just destroys the sound  a flanger is also not really advisable  you can use delay  just not with very rapid repeats  putting a compressor in front of your clean signal would probably make it more manageable for the pignose  speaker  i just bought a dynacomp  but haven t tried it on the piggy this is a good cheap first amp to buy for a youngster who is just beginning their journey on guitar and for practice when you are on the road on vacation or business  once the young  un seems dedicated  though  it is time to think about moving up to a vox ac15c1  note  that amp can do hard rock fine  but not high gain metal  or an engl screamer  i personally can t imagine recording with it  but y guess that would depend on the engineering skills available to you 
it s ok but a little cheaper quality than i expected   i would recommend going a little higher price   it also arrived cracked 
good length but very slippery   i had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn t slide around   i took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that i have been commented on a few times now   for the price  why not   be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric   as far as the base product  it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear 
for a cheap eq it does great  sometimes though when i hit the switch the light turns on and there is a second before the signal comes back  if it was not for that it would be a 5 star rating  i am not too worried about it because the pedal + loop pedal is still cheaper then the mxr or boss eq s
i have owned two of these stands  the first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared  the second one must have walked off on its own while i was moving to a new place  not the greatest stands by any means  but for what they re worth  i didn t mind spending another $10 to get one  sure there are other stands of much higher quality that are even more compact and portable  but price  ability to collapse  and it s light weight made it the one i bought    again 
great concept    everything rolled into one product   winder  string cutter and end pin remover   the price is fair for all that 
its great for cutting strings but the winder is pretty difficult if you don`t know what your doing  warning for beginners don t get this    
the winder works really well and same with the cutter  but using the cutter can be a bit cumbersome   i guess for taking w  you on gig bag would be great as you only have one tool  but if using at home  then i think is more convenient to have a separate cutter   that s what i do anyway   still i think is a good tool to have 
the peg winder is what it is  it winds pegs and there s not much to it  the string cutter is too bulky to use in most cases so i still need a set of snips when using this thing 
does the job well enough
a good piece of kit  except it does have problems removing occasional sticky string pegs  it s also squeakily noisy when string winding  the cutter works perfectly 
this winder and cutter   winds and cuts fine   but the pin puller does not fit my guitar pins even though the ad claims that  &#34    it fits virtually all guitars  banjos and mandolins   &#34   oh well   another lessson learned 
sometimes it seems more convenient to use my hand to turn the pegs rather than use this  but it does a pretty good job  i really like the string cutter built into the frame  and the peg puller is my favorite feature  basically  i use this for everything except winding strings 
i like dunlop products but    the push down applicators  dunlop s dab o matic applicator tops  are horrible idea  one popped right off the other day and oil got all over the place  i will not buy these again or i will remove them and just use a cloth 
in general it s ok but when you look at the fine writing on the fingerboard formula it says not to use on maple  which means i can t use it on either of my gibsons   probably better to just get the lemon oil for that separately 
i bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape   i guess this kit works okay  but it s hard to use   it will probably last my entire lifetime   i think a smaller kit would have been better   you really need to remove the strings when you use it  so you have to take off all the strings   i usually only replace one string at a time when i am changing strings  so i had to change my habits   if you have a guitar without a truss rod  that may mean you will take a lot more time tuning after you re done changing the strings  since the neck will bend more as you tighten the strings one at a time  and that will change the pitch of the strings you have already tuned   i m no expert  but i have a gut feeling that this was not money well spent   however  since i love my guitar  i use it anyway 
i have used ernie ball strings for along time   mostly slinky s or super slinky s   i read the review on these and thought i would give these a try for the sound they make paired with a lp i bought these to replace the stockers on the epi lp 100 i just bought   luckily i order two packs   i was putting on the top e string and had turned the crank less than a few times  not near enough tension on the string yet to even be in tune yet  and "pop" it broke  i had ordered two sets  so i put on the one from the new set  no problems until i got to the g string  then "pop" another breaker  very sad quality after finally getting them on and in tune  you will need to stretch the top 3 strings alot to get them to stay in tune  especially the e  i have to say they have a great sound to them   nice tone and sustain   great crucnhy sound for metal  but still a good clean tone too   these are thick strings  but still bendable  just not very far   i would rate the sound 5 stars unfortunately  it takes two packs of strings for one successful stringing to occur because of how brittle the strings are   so i have to give these three stars overall 
great highs and lows  but rough on the fingertips  and difficult doing barre chords  slides  and single string progressions  ok with more effort
i read a review saying that there bridge was floating out & the strings were hard to tune aswell as their e string popping  i had the exact same experience but i bought two sets since i know uncoated strings dont last long  so i did get to play em but all my strings  except the a & e  popped on both sets within two weeks i knew it was due to my bridge being made to use a whammy bar  which it came with btw & the tension it put on my tuning pegs what really got me upset about these strings was that they damaged my tuning pegs and now there harder to turn  have to use pliers sometimes  but the strings sound great & if i get a better guitar i might get these more often but for now im staying w  medium gauge elixirs 
i ve been playing guitar for over twenty years now and i ve tried just about every guitar string in existance and even these elixir coated strings   i ve come to realise that the benefits for a slightly longer life barely makes sense given the much higher price you have to pay for it   eventually  all strings corrode and lose their lustre and if you are a professional playing gigs  you change your strings so often anyway that to pay much more for polycoating doesn t make any sense   if you are the kind that occasionally takes out the axe then maybe this would make a difference but what i do is i get the least expensive ones and make sure i wipe down and clean them  even using products like string cleaners and fast fret to reduce finger squeak if necessary and my strings last for quite some time as well except at a much lower cost few people know this but only a few guitar stringmakers exist in the u s  and many of them that are retailed are actually the same strings with different brand names   granted elixir probably isn t one of these as they try to make hay with the time they have left on their patent of this polycoating technology but my thing is why pay so much more for strings when the benefit you get is really not so substantial as to justify the price   i myself use generic kyser stings for my classical and acoustic guitars and memphis electrics for my electric just because they are the cheapest i could find on the web and my sound has not been detrimentally affected in any way   in fact  you are much more likely to improve upon your sound by using better amps and guitar cables than you are with strings  at least most people would be able to hear the difference   don t get me wrong these elixir strings are not bad but you are much more likely to get a better sound by improving your technique  practice   getting better cables  pickups  amps  guitars etc than from just using these strings   for better string life  just wipe down and clean the strings before and after use   this discipline once a habit is good enough peace 
after about a month and a half i have noticed some corrision on the a and d strings at the 4th fret   that is a little disapointing because these are suppost to last 3 to 5 times longer than "regular" strings   i like the way they sound   they are a little harder to play than the d  addario strings that i am used to on my other guitar  and the martins that i have used in the past   if i still have to change them every 2 or 3 months they are not really worth the extra cost 
regardless of the string itself  i insist on honesty in advertising and marketing   so when i was earnestly considering ordering this string i read the summary  in which it was stated "elixir strings are coated in a unique way to protect wound strings from your dna and other contaminants "ohhhh    protects my string from dna   yeah  that dna really messes up guitar strings all right   in fact it s the worst contaminant ever    worse even than the oils and acids on our skin    worse than the cells themselves that contain and hold the dna from exposure because the dna is the blueprint of those cells  contained deep within protective walls   but somehow that nasty ol  dna leaks out and contaminates our guitar strings honestly   it s like none of us have ever attended a biology class because we re musicians as i read the reviews  i noted review after review after review that seemed like some sort of marketing promo   i noticed not one of those reviews indicated they had actually purchased the product from amazon   hmmmm the first honest review i found was one which said  "these strings sound somewhat artificial "  ah finally  one of the real reviews look  the product may be good or not   it may be the best string ever or not   but am i going to spend time and money testing a string that apparently can t stand on its own quality without bogus marketing hype we re musicians  not morons   if you want us to buy a string  be totally honest in the marketing   a quality string will sell itself by performance  sound and long life   no matter how heavy the marketing hype  if the string is bad you ll only sell one set   if it s good    you don t need the hype edit follow up   after reading numerous reviews  this does actually seem to be a good set of strings   which means the product can stand on customer testimony alone and shouldn t need spin to sell   just sayin      
the nanoweb strings do stay clean and they stand up but  on the negative side   i replaced one string in my set with a nanoweb and noticed right away the feel was slippery  when picking my fingers would slip on the nano string rather than pluck   i will stick to cleaning my good old standard strings 
i hesitate to write this review simply because it s pretty obvious nearly everyone else loves these strings  to be honest  i was very  very impressed with their feel and handling  i do think they re the best playing strings i ve used when it comes to pure playability  hands down  none better  they were butter smooth and great for flat picking  but for me it was a trade off  because i simply wasn t impressed with the tone  i even took the time to try them on three different guitars  all dreadnoughts   a classic maple sides spruce top  a mahogany back sides with spruce top  and a maple backs sides with a nato top  on all three  i didn t like the tone as much as the strings i was using  i really wanted to like them  but they simply didn t have the tone of the medium gauge martin sps i normally use this isn t to say they re not great strings that sound different on other peoples  guitars  but i simply didn t like them on mine  i love good projection with rich bass tones and ringing treble for the folk and traditional music i play in our jam group  the elixirs just lacked the punchy high tones of the martin strings i use  and the treble sounds tinny vs  the clear ring of the martins i normally use  to be fair  the bass strings sound great  and aren t much different  i would have to say choose your strings carefully based upon how you re going to use them  i play in acoustic groups  and the elixir strings just don t have what i need to be heard  in spite of how great they feel under your fingers  if playability is more important than great tonal range  then by all means buy these strings   you won t be disappointed  i m guessing these would be fine on an acoustic electric  where the electronics could compensate for the weaker treble tones 
sorry i noticed no difference i believe the price was really good for all the hype they put into these strings
if you like this guage you d like these   i just tried them  just to try   but i ve confirmed i like heavier gauges 
pricey as far as strings go   a lot of people swear by them but i get just as much tone and life out of strings that cost a whole lot less 
after all these reviews i expected the greatest strings ever  golden strands of glory that would last for a year with sparkling tonal perfection instead  i got a decent set of  10 s that lasted a whole hour before the d snapped at the neck pickup  i use a prs with a wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings  and i pre stretch them gently but completely  plus i tune down to eb for vocal and breakage reasons  so i break very few of my normal strings  slinky  10 s  ergo  a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal tension  tuned down  is unacceptable  especially when these strings cost three times as much as most all other electric strings as for the tone  it s definitely bright and almost too edgy  but nicely zingy all told  yet one negative i ve noticed after about 8 hours  loud playing with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings  making them harder to tune  sounds odd  i know  but when i replaced the d with a slinky d  replacing singles ain t cheap either at triple the price  please note   i ve since noticed that it tunes faster and in a tighter range than the elixir strings so  i must say i m summarily unimpressed so far with elixir electric strings what s the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast especially when it costs three times more and what s up with the tuning thing and why do these cost so much more  anyhow  is a micro thin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string  not when that string is toast in 50 minutes  zero doubt there anyhow  i ve got five elixirs and one slinky on my main ax now  so as they age i ll get a good feel for how the elixirs stay in tune and hold their tone  and i ll report back here in a while  and by the way  that slinky d sounds almost exactly the same as the elixirs  tonally  so much for magic elixir tone don t get me wrong  i really do want to love these  as i hate changing strings  but geez guys  how about some quality control if i m going to pay triple the price  then is it crazy to expect triple the quality  or heck  even just a little better   ps if you look at the d addario reviews  i love their acoustic strings   they respond to many of the reviews and questions  i hope that elixir will do the same here and address my questions  edit  and now  after only six hours  of playing on that guitar  the b string popped at the same place as the d  neck pickup  once again i ask  what good are strings that "sound good three times longer" if they break three times faster   edit  10 31 12  come on  after four more hours  the a string went  i only play that ax one or two sessions a week  and the next time i joked to the drummer  "which one will go today " he said he s amazed the g is still on  as he plays too and knows the g takes the most tension  an hour later  guess what  yep  so that s four broken strings in less than 20 hours  play  seriously not only are these not a good deal for 9 bucks  i d be bummed if they cost 3 bucks  the only plus i can think of at this point is they sounded good when new  but dang  unless you play totally smooth jazz or some such  i d stick with slinkies or d addarios  unless i got a "bad set"  which seems kinda lame for triple the normal price  in any case  these elixirs were just not worth the money   edit  3 3 13  i called elixir and told them about the multiple breakage  and they sent me another set  that set has taken a few four hour hard rock sessions with no breaks yet  thought the tuning issue remains  i ll add a star for good customer service and the hope that perhaps my first set was a dud  but honestly  at this price  there should be no duds at all  
i love the idea of this but i wish i had spent more for a better quality version  i had seen them used by others and chose this one but it is not well made  the number dial is not accurate and is loose so as you are using it you have to keep checking that it has not moved  it works but i ll probably end up getting a better one 
i would use this again  the plastic around the ball scraped away and the ball flew out making it useless
this switch does work  but you should look before you leap  the switch travel is greater than it is for a standard 3 way switch  and if you use the common fender replacement control plate  or one that was only intended for a 3 way switch  it may not fit  you could fairly easily alter the plate  but if you want the cleanest look possible you may want to investigate a new control plate 
the four way diagram that comes with the switch does not tell you which side to use  both sides have five tabs and look the same from the above diagram given no matter which way you turn it  i figured it would go the same way as the three way   wrong  you think fender would have the sense to figure this out  and give us a proper diagram  but guess again  just another example of the incompetence at fender 
these are nice and this was easily the best price around  these are made in japan  and i believe they re made for fender by gotoh  so they re good quality  but i was annoyed that they   the bushings  didn t fit the "standard vintage sized"  340" holes in my all parts neck   they re a little large  so be aware of that 
looks good but disappointed that they aren t made in the usa  oh well just shows me little by little more and more things aren t anymore 
i m using the guides to replace factory guides on my strat and tele  they will require that i drill a shallow hole to seat the guide properly  i hate drilling holes in guitars but it has to be done   the quality of these guides is not what i expected  they are cast and plated and have some rough edges to them  if you want a very clean looking finish i would look for a higher quality guide  at this point i m not even sure that i will use them 
meh  these things are what they are  they didn t solve any problems or make anything better   oh well  sometimes you just gotta do stuff for no reason 
i had a hard time lineing them up to install  the little knob on them made it very hard to install so good luck   
be careful about using capos like this  because if you re using a fine guitar  it may damage the finish   try it  and double check regularly  and i wouldn t leave it clamped on the guitar  overnight or for weeks on the guitar stand 
this is not the greatest product they make   but it works quickly and makes the 12 string spread when needed to do so more easily than most 
i was not a fan of this particular capo  it was good quality and the price was ok but just not my style 
thought i d try this but there s another brand that i prefer   needed to re shift this capo a lot to get it to hold down strings evenly and not mute some 
   but for a small woman with small hands  it s difficult to operate   it also exerts a whole lot of pressure on the strings  which can t be good for them   i ordered a schubb brand capo that s much easier to operate and doesn t smash the strings like a brute because the pressure is adjustable   the only drawback to the schubb is you can t clip it to the headstock  a convenience that s important to a lot of professional musicians   i m keeping both  if i need the convenience of this clip on style i ll use it   when playing at home i ll use the more gentle schubb 
like other reviewer wrote previously  i received less picks than advertised  i received a total of 7 picks   i don t know if the people at customs "borrowed" some from me  but i find very strange that more than one person is having the same problem  other than that  the picks are good  seem to be durable and produce a nice sound 
i gave this 3 stars simply because the review has to conatin a star rating  i have nothing to say against the product or the company  only that this is not a guitar case  it is a mandolin case  amazon should correct this stagg stb 10w  acoustic guitar bagepiphone case for epiphone dot  sheraton  335
i wanted to experiment with a thin pick  i like the action but thinner picks tend to "click" over the strings and i don t care much for that  these are certainly pretty though  and the feel is typical fender celluloid  smooth and a little slippery  might be hard to hold with sweaty fingers  celluloid is highly flammable  so be aware of that if you smoke  i don t  
i got this for my ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck   it took a few trys before i could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put   even so it was a good quality button   the leather is tough and will last for years   it will probably outlast the guitar if you re looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option   maybe if you have a martin it might be a better fit   but it s really worth the hassle 
these cables work very well at transmitting sound  so why only three stars  well  these are far from the most well thought out instrument cables you will find  these are stiff  thick  and heavy  while that s good for most analog cables  these cables are so stiff and heavy that  for instance  a portable tuner or a small stomp box might easily be moved around just by having one end of this cable in there with so many amps having plastic jacks these days  you have to wonder what kind of stress these cables might be putting your amp jacks and pickguard mounted output jacks under if these cables can fling a tuner around just by being plugged into one  i mean  let s face it  you never know what will happen at a gig  sometimes you re playing with a 12 foot cable when you should have a 18 foot cable  a cable shouldn t come out because of a gentle pull  but if it s between the cable falling out and it moving a bass head around or you tripping on it  you want the cable to fall out  if everything you have is heavy or velcro d to the ground  this isn t a problem  but it is for me  i feel like when you re playing with these cables  you re worried about stepping on the cable not because you want to pull it out  but because it s seriously like a trip wire out there lastly  these plugs are huge  that s not really a problem if you play a strat or a tele  but what about a p bass or a j bass where the plug comes out at a right angle from the body  this is going to stick out a lot  and to loop it around your strap  it s going to be a huge  stiff  cumbersome loop  i know people often buy 90 degree plugs for those kinds of instruments  but most normal straight plugs do just fine  so yeah  if you like to move around on stage  get more flexible cables  you ll thank me these cables are just poorly thought out  they d work great as patch cords  or keyboards  drum machines  from pedal board to amp  as long as you have a metal jack   monster has a cable that costs half as much but works twice as well for actual instrument use  and at that price  pro co cables are also excellent  and they have brand name plugs  as well 
the monster chord is great looking  but for me  they are too stiff  i play an acoustic guitar  so i don t run around a lot  the cord must be made to be able to take some abuse  but i don t need that 
i am using it with a musician s gear music stand   the shelf fits  but moves easily when moving stuff on the shelf of the stand   it is made out of plastic which flexes fairly easily and doesn t feel as sturdy as the metal shelf of the stand   there aren t any other options though unless you know some one who can do metal fabrication  it is a good thing it does not cost a lot 
this mic is fine  one should know that it has quite low gain and requires the use of a boost preamp for the guitar sound to be heard 
not sure if these are more on the brass side or the bronze  not really to my liking compared to the phospher bronze  the exps are nice strings  they have a nice feel to them along with less string noise  and they last  my two acoustic  guitars  a takamine mini jumbo and a gretsch jumbo  both made from mahogany are both nice sounding guitars  i figured i would try these 80 20 strings after using phospher bronze  only real problem i noticed is the 80 20s seem brighter and they ring longer  i prefer the warmer tone  and since my guitars have alot of "boom" already  i dont need the extra ring to complicate the sound with overtones when strumming fast  i imagine these strings may work in some instances  but i am going back to the phospher bronze for my guitars 
i like elixir   i had to try this one because of another friend said it s ok and cheaper i tried it and the quality is low end the sound is not as crisp the gauge is too heavy for my fingers  not their problem all 6 strings are wrapped inside one single bag i d go back to elixir next time 
i like d addario strings  but these did not impress me  they are not worth the extra cost  in my opinion 
not worth the price or matched the hype that you hear and read about  ghs strings are much cheaper and much better strings than these  i think they lasted a week on my guitar until i could get some more ghs or slinky acoustics on it 
i did not care for the tone or feel  took them off within an hour and put back on ej16  they had a rough feel and were stiff  lots of folks like them but not for me 
i read the reviews of the few similar options  i went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean  not much of that complaint here  but this definitely has that problem my guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes  so this can t go in several out of the way places i had hoped would work  also  i was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact 2 guitar rack  however  the angle makes that very awkward i hope to modify it to work  but i m not super hopeful at this point  will probably have to manufacture something to replace it  
after trying out a few other styles and brands  i settled on this stand  wanting something that would keep my 50s telecaster from taking an unexpected fall  the overall design of the stand is great  but i had to return my first stand  as there were severe quality issues with the finish  there were at least 3 spots where the black finish didn t stick to the metal  and i essentially had bare metal spots sticking out  the neck portion was also sitting cockeyed about 15 degrees to the right  once it was clamped down to the main stand body  disappointingly  the replacement unit i received also has this issue  but only about 7 10 degrees worth  i m going to use this stand in the meantime while i try to find something of a nicer finish  and truly worthy of my guitar 
i don t like that i have to continually tighten the knob at the back of the stand to keep the neck rest from tilting or moving and eventually falling down  the solution  tighten the crap out of it with a wrench until you get it very snug and it won t budge 
not easy to set up  hard to tighten down  works well enough as a filter once you get it placed 
you may wat to reconsider buying any filter on this model  the top  filter  part is essentially pantyhose wrapped around a cardboard tube despite this  the clamp and adjuster parts are relatively good in all honesty  buy a nicer filter  or none at all  they do not make a huge difference on recording quality unless you re using top of the line microphones  if this is the case  spend the money to get a nicer filter one nice thing  these keep artists from getting too close to the mic and essentially making out with them  i found that quality nice when dealing with    passionate vocalists 
its ok  the adjust ability is not what i would like but it does have some uses and its built like a tank  i got this for free from my girlfriend who had it given to her from some old guy who told her it was a broken distortion pedal so i can t complain about it not being worth what i paid for it  i currently have this on my pedal board along with a digitech mainsqueeze which is less expensive  more adjustable and just more versatile  would i buy this  yes if i didn t try anything else first  nuff said 
more knobs are not always better   in the case of this pedal  the controls are really sensitive  there s a pretty big mid hump that s hard to dial out  and the low end control can make things really boomy  or add a little chunk to the sound   you can do a lot with it  but i struggle to find what it does best  because it doesn t really do edge of distortion well  it doesn t clean up   and it s not a really high gain distortion pedal  but it can just add a bit of tightness  hair metal mids  or thump to a standard od sound   basically  if you have your amp set for 70s rock  you can stomp on this and get motley crue or maybe bark at the moon era ozzy like a tubescreamer  this thing lets a little bit of the clean signal through so you hear the distorted guitar mixed with clean signal   the circuit design is nothing like a tube screamer  but it can work as a substitute   i think if you wanted the tube screamer sound  thejoyo jf 01 "vintage overdrive" pedalwould be better just for simplicity sake and being more of a clone  so it s not bad  but its just not on the level of boutique pedals and their clones   if you get tired of it  give it to your bass player or try it with a bass for an interesting tone 
i ve tried to like this pedal  i really have   maybe it s my signal chain      my experience with the digitech series is that they suck the tone out from your guitar   sure  the od is there  but it isn t worth losing your tone  is it   again  i reiterate maybe it s just me   i have been messing around with signal chains for almost 3 decades now   and the blue pedal isn t any different  either imo   grunge was ok  but not my kind of style 
this beginner level guitar is very good quality for the price  it s lightweight and has attractive but basic finishes  the biggest drawback is that the one i received required the action to be adjusted  the bridge needed lowered slightly and the nut held the strings way too high above the frets  the result was very sore fingers  these are easy fixes if you have the proper tools  otherwise you ll have to pay a guitar shop to do a proper setup  stock strings have a warm tone 
this is nearly identical to theguardian cases cg 020 b bass guitar caseat about half the cost  however  there are some issues with this case as well as limitations first the issues  while the covering appears to be stitched on  it is   for the most part   glued on  and if the case is left in a hot  unventilated space like a car for prolonged periods the covering will start to life at the edges  on the other hand  someone who takes care of their gear is probably not going to leave their instrument in a hot car  or garage or other storage space  for prolonged periods  however  you should be aware of the issue  if for no other reason than to remind you that if they case suffers  imagine the effect on your bass the limitations are simple  the case  while a hard shell design  is not as strong as one made from abs plastic  the top is relatively flimsy as are the sides  this is not a show stopper if you use the case for home storage and occasional gigs  but if you have a heavy road schedule  and especially of you are not personally loading and unloading the band s gear  this case will not afford you the protection of an ata style case also note that i have only used this case for a fender jazz bass  so any long scale j  or p style basses will fit  i cannot be sure about other brands and models i mentioned an ata style case as a better solution  and it is essential for protecting your instrument if you have heavy road or even local gig schedules  for less demanding protection i recommend that you also consider this case  which i purchased as an upgrade when i became aware of the issues and limitations of the musician s gear model skb electric bass rectangular hardshell  standard latches  handle if you still opt for the musician s gear case  you are still getting relatively good value and are certainly making a large step up from a soft gig bag 
it s great if you need to quickly drop your hats  but not the other way around  i bought this drop clutch because it was cheap  and i was on a budget  overall its build is solid  the only problem i have with it is having the clutch lock back into place 
i was very impressed by this little guitar  the build quality seemed good and toggle and pods were noiseless the only complaints i have is e string breaks often  which is a direct result of constant tuning fatiguing the strings i feel the tuners are just not strong enough and the ratio is no adequate to keep in tune still a great guitar for a 5 to 10 year old 
i ve been playing over 30 years and got one of these for my 7 year old because he wants to play guitar like daddy does   for $100 it s an ok starter guitar for a kid  and i guess really short people who can t play a regular fender   but not something i d recommend to anyone else   and my kid thinks it looks cool  so he ll be more likely to stick with it even though it has a laminated body  the headstock and unfinished neck are decent wood   the frets are crowned ok but have some sharp ends to them  and i feel silly investing the cash to have them fixed   it s light and easy to handle   the hardware isn t bad  with a stable bridge  good idea not to put a floating trem in this   5 way blade switch  solid jack and strap anchors  and smooth knobs   the pickups are not top notch but work well enough  a decent replacement set would cost more than the whole guitar does  so i m not complaining    it has a nice red paint job on the down side  besides some sharp fret ends  it required a few truss rod and bridge adjustments to bring the action close to where it should be   the fretboard uses cheap rosewood and in one spot has some extra glue showing around a fret   the nut on the one i got is sunk lower on the treble side than on the bass side  so the low e string is farther from the fretboard than the other strings   it has one small pit in the red finish   it has no paperwork or owner s manual   the tuners are kind of choppy   and the body neck flexes so if you put too much pressure on it the whole thing will go out of tune it comes strung with fender 9 s  which combined with the short scale makes the strings loose and easy to press down  so it s good for a kid just starting out   i actually enjoy messing around with it because the pickups have a punkish scratchy sound   but as soon as he gets bigger we ll ditch this for something better 
i used this on the side of a wooden bookshelf for my ukulele   it s attractive   it s well made  it s fork is a tad large for the ukulele  it has rubber o rings that slide  so i can bring them in and the uke does fit then   but then  even the three inch deep uke is close to the bookcase  or wall  if you use it there    the uke hits when i put it in the hanger  so i put a felt pad where the uke body hits the bookcase many uke players simply nail a single nail in the wall and use a loop off string from it around the uke head and tuners   this is much less expensive  holds very well  is even more low profile than this hanger  and never drops a uke  consider it for your needs i d not buy another of these for a ukulele   it likely works fine for a guitar  though i deducted one point for the fact that  even though it s adjustable  the o rings   and advertised for ukes  it doesn t work well for them   and it s heavy and not stylish  in my opinion   i have the hercules wall hanger  mechanical gripper  for my electric guitars  and it s fabulous  for guitars  overkill for lightweight ukuleles  maybe  hercules stands wallmount guitar hanger gsp39wbupdate 9 7 11  the more i use it  the less i like it   i find that friction tuner ukuleles do not fit on it well at all  and the tuners hit the fork and it can make your uke out of tune   so  for small instruments  you d have to try it yourself with mandolins and banjos   this is atrocious   for guitars  it s not as good as hercules 
on stage makes decent products  but this one would have been awesome if the actual table of the stand would fold one or more times  that would have been perfect  otherwise  it works fine 
these are excellent  inexpensive guitar strings  they are perfect for somebody that plays gigs and changes strings frequently  for the more casual player  these might not be the best choice for the gigging musician  there is nothing better than these d addario strings  they are light weight  have great sound  and are inexpensive  these might take a very slight nod over ernie ball strings for the more casual musician  somebody that isn t changing their strings once a week  these are probably not a great choice  personally  i use elixir strings on my electric guitars  a les paul 2008 standard and a 1982 gibson lucille  i do not play gigs  so a set of strings doesn t see an hour or two of really hard playing per night  the coating on elixir s helps keep corrosion down and is easier on my fingers  i like their feel a bit better than these strings  i get about a month of playing from those strings  sadly  these d addario strings are really only good for about one or two weeks of playing i ve tried a variety of strings  ernie ball  elixir  and d addario  on my guitars and the way i play  the elixir s just sound and play the best to me  of course  your mileage may vary  if i did start to play gigs  i would probably switch to a more affordable string like these a silly cosmetic thing  i hate the packaging of these strings  d addario makes a huge deal out of reduced packaging and being environmentally responsible with their products  the strings come in a cardstock outer box  with a single plastic package inside  each string size has a different colored ball on the end to help a person figure out the string gauge  i change strings myself  and i really prefer the individual paper envelopes for the strings  with the gauge clearly printed on the package  if you are new to changing strings  or only change them infrequently  this all in one package will confuse the heck out of you  especially at first  i preferred to work with one string at a time d addario also makes a major deal out of the serial number on their package to help fight fake strings  their website has a place to enter the serial number to verify the package of stings is authentic  i kind of disliked the fact that you have to enter an email address to even get started  they could have very simply left a spot to enter the serial number with no other information necessary in the end  the silly colored balls at the end of the strings  well they look goofy on my guitars  i wouldn t mind the colors on an acoustic  the ball gets hidden by the peg anyway   but those balls are visible on my electric guitar  i just prefer the simple gold balls on the ends of other strings 
i read all of the reviews and bought 6 pairs of these based on the reviews so  i put these on my gibson les paul last night and played for a few hours   i didn t hammer the strings  just played easy  mostly the eagles as i was hanging the guitar on the wall afterward  i took a quick look at the strings   i was shocked to see the high e and b strings were already flattened   i never would have expected wear after just a few hours of light playing the strings sounded great  but by the time i had them stretched enough that they would hold tune  they were already worn i guess i m going to have to go to heavier strings so i m not changing strings every few days   these just did not perform as expected giving these 3 stars is being generous   i have 5 sets to use up now  damn   i was using light gauge and thought these mediums would hold up  but they lasted for only two hours      my fender 3250l bullets at least lasted a few weeks   going to try the fender on my gibson and see how they sound   i m still in search of the "perfect" set of strings   i m open to suggestions
d addario are the best strings that i have tried  i used to use ernie ball super slinky s but found that these last longer  the ernie s bend and play well but they tend to  go dull faster not to mention the ernie s start corroding within a week  these d addario strings stay brighter longer  i usually change them about every 4 weeks  the ernie s only last me a week  2 weeks at the most  that can get expensive fast  all around the d addario strings are the strings 4 me  retraction  when i originally wrote this review i thought they were the best  turns out they are in fact way better than ernie ball strings  but they are no longer my preference  a friend of mine told me about dr strings and they are much better than these d addarios  dr s last three times as long as d addario  the dr s cost a lil more but they are way better  for the money addarios are good but i would recommend spending a few dollars more for dr strings
they are ok not a big fan tho they have a odd metal sound when you play them  i had earnie ball on previously and i might switch back or go to dunlop witch i put on my 7 sting and love   but i probably won t get these again      ever 
d addario makes great strings  this just where not the gages i was lookin for other than that i like this brand of strings
it works for what it is  it just feels a little light when you wind after getting the tension up   not a bad product  just don t know how long it will last 
this device is ok  it is light weight and folds nicely  but it is not especially stable  convenient storage is its biggest plus 
i picked up one of these at guitar center a while back   at first  it seemed unstable  but then i tried to open it up a little more  and it kind of clicked into the position shown in the picture here   when it s opened up all the way  it is relatively stable  and is suitable for servicing your own guitar   as others say  it does fold up nicely  and takes up minimal space in my toolbox   i wouldn t use this if i made a living servicing guitars  as i don t think it would last long due to the quality of materials  it does feel pretty cheap    but it does work well enough for an individual who does work on their guitars once in a while i imagine one could make something a bit more sturdy for less out of wood and felt   over all  i m happy with the purchase  as it suits my needs 
i was expecting something a little bigger  it will do  but next time  i probably will look for something with a little more stability 
this is a really nice item and i got two of them   unfortunately one of them did not thread properly into the base and i had to force it which has created a little wobble   that s the problem with mail order  sometimes on a cheap item its not worth the time and expense to exchange it  oh well so far its working ok with the my old classical  beater  guitar i have hanging on the faulty one   the other unit seems to be rock solid  oh and by the way these hooks are too skinny for a classical guitar 
these hangers work great but make sure you purchase some spare screws   the screws provided easily break when screwing into a stud so i would recommend you buy some good screws before you install   i have several of these and at least three screws broke as i screwed them into the stud in the wall 
this is an ok solution to keeping your picks handy and organized  at least you can have one place where you can find a pick  as opposed to having them scattered all over the house and in every case  but a small baggie will work just as well  maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage  sometimes  depending on the amount and size of the pick  it s hard to get the pick out of the holder  and if you use something other than the standard shape  forget it   it has an adhesive backing  so i guess you can stick it on your amp guitar wall small animal  but i d rather not 
i m rather disappointed with this item as i put only four  4  picks into it when it snapped apart  i use the dunlop tortex 1 0 mm picks and perhaps that s where i was at fault   i maybe should left it at three picks however  my bench vise and some superglue have remedied the situation nicely  thus beware of how many picks and their gauge before you push them into this holder i give it 3 out of 5 stars for reasons stated 
it hold my picks well  but some are to big for it and the tape foam on the bottom looses the stick quickly  im neutral on this one 
i own three of these  and have them attached to the back of my headstocks  great idea  great concept and great quality  only problem is that they do not work with the smaller picks that i have recently adopted  dunlop jazz iii  the dunlop max grip jazz iiis and my dava jazz picks just won t stay in there without slipping out for regular sized picks  it s a perfect product  for smaller sized picks i improvise by using sd card cases    perfect fit for jazz picks 
it didn t seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless  it may work well with dunlop picks but not for theplanet waves 10 standard guitar picks   duralin blue ###gt    medium heavy  also the thicker the pick  the fewer it will hold  it has sticky back foam tape on it for mounting to a surface like your amp or whatnot  i ve found it mostly not useful thus far  maybe it would help more when playing live so i can grab for a pick and know they will be there 
does what it is designed to do  it holds about 6 picks   small piece of adhesive tape on the back  the supplier refunded some of the postage   amazon promised to credit my account $10  credit never appeared  for the highly inflated shipping costs   a $2 item cost $17 70 for shipping   be careful and read everything before you click to submit the order 
in my humble opinion  the pictures make the product look purple   they re not purple   at least the ones i was sent   they were charcoal i bought them specifically to use with my daughter s purple washburn guitar  so it s kind of annoying other than the color  there s nothing wrong with them 
i quess this pic holder may be a pretty good idea but just not something i would use but as i said  it s ok 
it is not expensive  but the item is sort of cheap   i could have used a baggy to hold my picks 
not the greatest cord i have ever used  not the worst either  i would prefer fender tweed cables over this one if i had to make a recommendation 
this is just your typical nylon strap  a bit stiff  but durable    i love the celtic design enough to use this strap  but ordinarily i prefer higher quality materials than the nylon and plastic construction  with leather ends    the leather is also a bit stiff  but not so stiff that it s not functional or reliable   if dunlop made this in cotton and steel  i d pay 4x as much for it   
good idea  tends to slip on the strings however  convenientt to have a pick at the end of the neck 
absolutely obligatory for any fan of rock n roll jamming with tastes of jazz influenced rock  1970 s influences   i would probably buy the phase 100 today though  as it has 4 different positions to choose from  i assume including the original set up as one of them well  i need to correct this   this review was for the old models   the new models have far too high midrange and the components are no longer easily modified   i thought i was replacing an old model with the new one  but alas the new is not worthy of a place in my effects chain i will probably get an eh small stone now  though that pedal looks like it may have been changed lately too   sadly it appears boutiques are being bought by non musical business men who care only about the bottom line and not enough  if at all about the sound quality of their products   the capitalists have become too greedy  and the socialists think they are worthy to tell everyone else how to live   god help us 
i returned this because i wanted the script version instead  very different sound  watch youtube to compare models  this pedal seems older as well 
this is a great pedal for price  no it s not the most amazing phase pedal  but it s still quality  i know many pedal geeks who still have it on their board  if you don t use a lot of phaser but need it for a song or 2  buy it 
i definately helps cut down &#34 wind whistle&#34  on my mic  can t say anything great about the product but i cant say anything bad  it does what it is suppose to
its a windscreen  this is the first one i have bought but it seems to work how it is supposed to  it could be less dense i think  idk
this microphone clip becomes loose at the hinge very quickly  and needs to consistently be tightened  too much of a hassle  really~
very tight fit which is great for your stationary mic  it hold the mic with no concerns of the mic falling out  great for back up singers  
i wish i bought longer cables but these cables are fine  they do what they are supposed to do but i know i can spend a few more dollar dollar bills and get a higher quality cable but the tonal difference wouldn t be anything significant 
i got these because i work as a live sound engineer and they sometimes come in handy used as interconnects between guitar pedals 
bought this on a whim   it works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion   when used with a pedalboard rig  it doesn t add much except for hiss  unfortunately   sweet sound with an older fender amp unit  though   does not sound good with updated equipment  line 6 equipment  roland units   i d say definitely do not get this if you re a tech or gear head   get it if you re a simple player with few fx in your arsenal   it does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar  amp  wah  and guitar  or amp  wah  guitar  and expression pedal   nothing else i ve tied it to has seemed to work out  though   probably a wasted product with where i m headed as a technical player  but good for beginners and intermediate levels   into king crimson fripp styles   don t go for this for modeling 
it is taking a chance on ordering a guitar online i took the chance and got what most of the reviews already shared here s my take pros   cheap  $90 is very inexpensive for a guitar   well packaged for shipping  arrived 1 day early  fair quality  this is not a top of the line or even middle of the line guitar  it is a cheap guitar that does have some decent craftsmanship  but not stellar   good sound  this does have a very good sound  with new strings of course  size  this is not a full size guitar  but larger than a 3 4  it is a "concert" size which i like   it is a cut away design without electronics  this combo is very rare   fair to good wood materials and furniture  good design  this guitar sounds good  feels good  looks very good   matte finish  this comes with a matte finish  not shiny  i like thatcons   strings  corroded poor quality strings  neck condition  neck has slight bend  i needed to adjust the truss and file a few frets  there is still a slight dip and bump at the 12th fret causing fret buzz   frets are not smoothed on ends  neck surface is not sanded well but smooth enoughi like this guitar  it s very inexpensive  needs a little work  sounds very good  i hope this information help you make an informed choice about a guitar purchase 
as title says 1  high action2  inadequate loudness for pickingi compared this to the mitchell md100 and think the mitchell is very good for it s price you can compare both at guitar center 
i chose this rating because a fine paper towel seems to work just as well as this microfiber polish cloth 
compared to ernie ball s cloth  it s good enough for wiping down things   it is soft and non abrasive  eb s cloth has that and also has a clinging element which seemingly cleans and absorbs  overall good cloth for general use 
sorry  but i m not as smitten with this cloth as some of the other reviewers  it s okay  good size  works pretty well  but sheds when new  and despite claims of being laundry safe  the edges began to unravel after the first wash  i used with planet waves restore polish and got good results  but probably would not buy again 
works as advertised for polishing my guitars  i don t use any other cleaners such as fender polish when i use this cloth 
i ve owned this pedal for about 8 years   it s good overall  but the reverbs fall short of ideal for me   they just sound a bit inauthentic  and this is noticeable at times  but in a band setting probably wouldn t be noticable   i think it s the way they trail off   the tails tend to have a little unnatural decay  or something i ve been using the boss fender reverb pedal for about 3 years now as my main reverb  neither of my amps have reverb  and what i ve done in the last year is that i use this digitech with a wetter setting  usually church or hall  if i want reverb on a solo   for that application it works fine and sounds great   as a "leave it on all the time" reverb i find it a bit lacking but if you want a bunch of decent sounds you could do much worse   plus this thing is obviously rugged  i ve abused it  not really  just regular gigging abuse  for all this time and it s never failed to work   but that s been my overall experience with digitech stuff for a long time 
the digitech main squeeze is an okay compression pedal  do i use it  yes  however  i would likely trade it for an mxr or dunlop if i had the opportunity  it doesn t sound bad per se  but does have some hiss to it  it also boosts your signal  a noticeable volume increase   while some may like this  i want my compressor to be a little more subtle and just provide some added sustain 
as soon as i got this pedal i put it on my board and noticed it had a high end hum  i have a 2 behringer pedals on my board and a lot of people say they are bad noisy pedals but my pedal board was silent till i put this pedal on it  i ve only had it for a few days  but the cons out way the pros  maybe i will purchase a noise reducer to help clean it up a bit  once i get around to playing with it i will write another review 
this is a perfect strap sized just right for mandolin i would have given it five stars except mine arrived with a paper label glued to the back of the strap  which when peeled off left a sticky spot on the strap where it would press against the mandolin finish 
ok quality and certainly better than a piece of rope   i found it a bit uncomfortable for sure but for the money it is worthwhile 
it was very hard to get the hole in the strap over the button on my mandolin   at least it won t fall off soon   i just got another mandolin with no button  and this strap has no way to attach to it 
isn t it sad when somebody produces a great product but screws up on the description  the product is great value for money and worth while buying  if for no other reason than save money on overpriced dc power units from the manufacturers of the pedal units  trouble is that they do not say whether or not the cables come with the unit  they don t   dumb of them  as all they needed to say  was you needed to buy them separately  which i later did  seems like nit picking  well  it s not as live abroad and these things take a long while to come down to me  sloppy isn t it 
as other reviewers have noted  the ends are too short and dont allow the cable to "click" into the jack of your guitar or amp  easily remedied by cutting back the rubber by about 1 8" then the cable is fine other than that i like the cable construction and the large sized ends 
   strings i use d addario strings on my acoustic and electric guitars as well they are great   they have a really nice sound and don t cost an arm and a leg   
     i m going back to what works best for me  martin sp custom light  while the packaging  sealed  for each set is a good thing and also the individual color coding of each string  i do prefer martins  
i gave these strings a try  but i don t care for them that much  i have always used sp s or elixir s  and i don t think that will change after trying these 
i have been using these strings for years and have been happy with them but the last couple of sets have lost the tone completely on strings 4 5 6 within 3 days of installing   i play professionally and have a lot of experience installing strings  nothing wrong on the guitar   hopefully the next set will be better
i just had a guitar setup with dr pure blues 9 s and they sound pretty good but they are a bit stiff i ve also noticed a bit of what i must presume is the nickel coating seems to come off on my fingertips after practicing for an hour or so it almost looks like graphite on my fingers but it is nowhere near as "black" as the oxidation i ve seen from low quality strings they also seem to have more "string squeak" when changing chords than other brands   even after generously spritzing them withfingerease guitar string lubricanti am not qualified to say if they truly give you that "vintage tone" but they do sound decent however  for $6 i would rather getdean markley blue steel lt 2552 electric guitar strings   009  042 or save some money and go withd addario exl120 electric guitar strings  super light  9 42 evenernie ball super slinky string set  9   42 seem to feel better to me  but i am a da dairy o man  for now 
all 12 of mine broke within a year and the jacks got bent pretty easily  so i switched back to the plastic ones which have lasted me over 2 yearshosa cfs606 6 inch right angle fx pedal cable  6 packand they are still going strong 
well  i have another strap that looks like this one  but i can tell you that this is cheaper on the materials  anyway  it does what is supposed to do and i m happy with it  i wasn t looking for anything expensive  but this works really good    if you want something to just practice with this is what  you should get  i recommend it 
bought this with my first guitar just to have anything to hang it from  it does the job  nothing at all fancy about this strap  two faux leather ends  some nylon web and a triglide  will do the job until you find the one of your dreams 
i got two of these but wish i had got better ones  using them on the black thinline and the washburn classical 
kind of cheap and digs into the neck a bit but i only use it for walking around the house strumming when i am playing my secondary guitars   it s fine for the price 
this strap is not a bad one  but it just did not fit my guitar  so that is the only problem  i have a classical guitar and sadly  this strap does not fit it 
i got an ernie ball strap instead of a planet waves strap
it fits good and came in the color i expected  but there was one thing wrong  the strap had a small stain  i don t know why  it said it was brand new  but maybe not 
the power supply which is not included is a funky size  it does seem to work with a standard pedal power supply but i wouldn t recommend it only because it is not the proper size   the guy that was using this was using it with a fender telecaster  and a single 12&#34  tube amp   he found that the volume was cut by ~ 15 20% even with the pedal turned all the way up   any time a pedal allows for volume loss   it tends to effect tone & yes  mr  sound engineer  &#34 tone&#34  is a real thing the pedal is pretty bulky and won t fit well in most pedal boards  but it s not any more wide than the morley  but it seems to be taller  longer  and heavier i gave it 3 stars because  &#34 it s okay&#34   but it is far from great  and i would not buy this product again   i understand the price is cheap  and if this is all you can afford  then go for it  but if you have the extra cheese  spread it 
i ve wired and rewired countless guitars and have had a couple fail recently  don t know if their qc has gone downhill or what  i didn t send them back because they re usually around $10 but it s disconcerting when a fender product unexpectedly fails  it would have 5 stars but for the recent failures 
a bit wimpy  but so far they are holding up 
back plate has a "greenish" tint  and is single ply  not 3 ply as advertised color wasnt as advertised  its more of an "off white" than a vintage cream  but i guess its close enough considering the price shipping took far too long   not sure if music123 or usps is to blame for that  but id go with usps besides those minor faults  the items fit well and look good my 2006 strat now has the look of a  57  without the huge price tag 
i was happy it was made in the usa but was missing switch tip and had two cracked knobs  might have happen in shipping but switch tip wasn t done by shipping 
i purchased this for my love of playing guitar  i like blues style and classic rock  this 25 watt amp will get the job done  it is not to be expected as a high quality amp by any means  after a few months of playing the bass knob just blew  so i had no bass control  arrived pretty fast and had no issues as far as tears or dings in the packaging  you just have to mess around with the knobs to get the tone you want  took me like half an hour to get the right amp settings this amp is rated 75 watts  so technically you could upgrade the speaker to say a 50 watt  into 8 ohm   i would definitely recommend upgrading the speaker to a celestion or jensen  i d recommend it  but don t buy it if your looking for a really decent tone  it s just a practice amp 
base is heavy and sturdy so your mics won t topple over  but an arm on it and that could be a different story  the action on the height adjust was a little finicky for me but not enough for me to worry about  while i appreciate the weight of the base  i do kind of wish there was a lighter solution to keeping it stable with a heavy mic mounted on an angle 
these are good  i dont see that they are any better than other basic strings in their price range   they all work well   length of being brillant is somewhat limits  but it appears to be in most of these level of strings 
for the price of these strings  you can t go wrong  however  compared to elixers  the sound just isn t as &#34 full &#34 
decent strings but the little e string broke while i was stringing the guitar other than that  they appear ok nothing to rave about 
these strings honestly aren t for rhythm  they bend too easily  making rhythm playing impossible  on the plus side  for soloing  you can t go wrong with these  honestly  i would get the hybrid slinkys over these 
i ll re rate this item if my problem is fixed but maybe this is normal    i have a vox ac30hw2x and i put this jj 12ax7 into v1   i have a significant volume gain reduction now   i know it s the tube because i can put the stock ruby back into v1 and the volume gain is back   i haven t checked yet but i d say there is a 40 50% loss in volume   i was thinking maybe this is a higher headroom tube   it s not stamped to be one so that s why i m confused   is it typical of jj to have more headroom  i m not digging this tube so far so back in goes the ruby 
these tubes just aren t for me  they don t sound great   kind of flat and lifeless  also unreliable  one  out of 7  arrived doa and another has failed since
