i got it to have it if i needed it  i have found that i don t really need it that often and rarely use it  if i was really good i can see the need  but this is a keyboard not an organ 
this fender cable is the perfect length for me  sometimes i find it a bit too long but i don t mind  the build quality is great and i know that it will last  the only gripe i have with this cable is that the metal sleeve gets unscrewed way too easily  requiring me to tighten it often sound quality is not affected  and the color is cool  definitely try this cable out 
this is a cool looking cheap cable which works well  i bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault  one thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile  you ll be able to hear them rattle  it seems that the  retro  look is screw on connectors over some black rubber  but other than that  the cable looks cool and works well i also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly  i bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables  it s easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident  the green cable is good for that 
very good cable  well made and it looks great with my candy apple red tele  the reason i gave it only 4 stars is because it tends not to lay flat on the floor 
cant go wrong  great quality on a budget price    hosa is the go to when you need to hook things up
the hosa xlr cables are affordable and very heavily made i have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere i decided to purchase shorter cables and the hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly you really will not be disappointed with these 
hosa products are a good bang for the buck  i haven t looked up the specifications  but i m guessing the wire is 22 to 24 awg  but since it s only 10  long  it s good enough 
this cable seems like it will last me for a while  as it is only being used to connect a di box it will not get abused as much as the vocal mics always do 
these are not the greatest but they re cheap and they get to you fast when you need them  i ve only had one fail and i ve bought many of them to use in our broadcast studio amazon is the first place i go when i need cables for audio  video  computers or concert lighting good music to all 
this is a fine cable at a decent price point  nothing exceptional mind  but it gets the job done well enough 
i bought this cord after returning a cheap one that i should ve known better than to buy  my son  who has some experience as a musician recommended the hosa brand when i was seeking a proper replacement i bought it for a small home recording setup which includes a behringer c 1 condenser microphone and a behringer xenyx 302 mixer  and both ends make a reliable connection to both the board and the mic  the sound quality is excellent an excellent value for the money 
this is a very nice cable for the price  i already bent one end of it though  fortunately it still works fine  inside the phono connector the wires are covered by white shrink plastic  haven t noticed any hum or crackles  for sure a good buy 
cheap and good texture rubber that does not get stiff   only time will tell how well the soldering is   sounds fine to me 
i am not hard on cables   i typically just plug them in to my guitar  dont move around much  and play for an hour or two a day   this one seem to perform just fine   no buzz  and or other noises noted   i have several of them and they have all performed well 
this my second hosa guitar cable    the other one is shorter    like my first hosa cable  this is a high quality item   i d definitely buy more cables of this brand 
good product at a good price  have used it multiple times and works well with my guitar and speaker  great to have when friends come over to jam 
hosa cable quality can be all over the place  some of their products are good  sound good  reliable  long lasting  and some of their products are not good  affect sound negatively  break prematurely  short useful life span  these guitar cords are actually quite nice  they feel good  gooey soft rubber jacket like mogami   they sound good and so far they are working reliably  the rubber jacket is about  25&#34  in diameter  by eye  and there is a short heat shrink overwrap to add strength where the wire enters the plug i bought these when i needed cables fast for an internet concert  we had lots of pedals and signal splits to connect up  these cables arrived in good working condition and we ve been using them continuously since we have over a dozen tube amps and are very particular about sound degradation but so far these cables have not disappointed anyone i would buy more if i needed them 
for the price  fantastic they do feel light and i don t trust the build quality at the key stress points  where cable meets connector   but then again i am not going to push it set your guitar down on it by accident when it s plugged in and   who knows but for seven bucks it gets the job done  recommended if you are doing the "beginner" thing and testing the waters otherwise  spend a few more bucks for something with higher chances of lasting 
only complaint is the size which is my fault  if you can buy at least a 15 foot if you plan to use it on stage 
i ve been using these for about 3 weeks now   they are strong but flexible and don t seem to develop kinks or bending "habits" if you roll them up the proper way i ve seen and used some better cables but not at this price point   and i ve certainly seen quite a few worse   this is a pretty good sweet spot  in my opinion 
if you re like me  you probably bought this to hook up an xlr microphone to a digital recorder or a pc it works fine for the handy type recorders but forget hooking this directly to a pc   way too much noise 
this adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small dv cameras will function but with caveats first  it s construction is pretty light weight  that means you will have to be "gentle" with it when using it  that s something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up second  the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it  this is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera  that means you would need another short xlr mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter so just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others  i went to sam ash music and found a similar adapter cable  heavy duty  and with a longer cable for the same price  it pays to shop around 
well made  works as it should  however  seem to be getting a little bit of noise from a shotgun mic straight into a d800   more than the usual expected to see if it was the mic  cable  or adapter  tested it going straight into a zoom h4 recorder seems to be a little but more noise going through this adapter cable than straight into the xlr input no big surprises  minor clean up in post 
haven t used it yet but if it s like the other cables i have from the same company  it should work fine 
this is what it is    a super cheap mono cable  it should be sufficient for many needs and is cheap enough that thin wire gauge and such can be forgiven  just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded  etc for the price and intent  i almost gave it 5 stars  but it s not a 5 star cable    it s a fair quality ultra cheap cable  4 stars seems about right   yes  this is almost exactly what i wrote about the other hosa cable i reviewed  
this l jack is good enough to make connections between my guitar pedals and it works fine  flexible enough  i don t like only the fact that it s made out of plastic and it looks cheap  but for the price i paid for it i don t really care 
these little patch cables work nicely  there s no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fine  i m only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5  the product description says 6 inches  right  if you jump over to these  http   www amazon com gp product b001pgxkc8 ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02 ie=utf8&psc =1  planet waves patch cables they re listed at  5 feet  same as 6 inches  right   the hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches  whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another  i only used the hosa cable as an emergency back up to conclude  would i recommend these  yes  if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable  go for these  but my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else 
works just fine  great for little spaces between one pedal to another  if there s more distance  better use another type  bue generally works fine and it s a good quality product  clean signal no problems
these cable came super fast in the mail  they deliver the level of performance you would expect form low cost cables  they work
i bought 6 of these xlr to 1 4&#34  adapters hoping to connect my microphones to an old funky mixer i owned with 1 4&#34  inputs   it didn t end up working because i discovered i needed to convert the microphone level to line level  which these don t do   however they do convert xlr to 1 4&#34  balanced quite well   just not what i needed in my particular situation 
as the title says  it works   the only reason i took off a star is sometimes it gets a little stuck and i have to use some force to get it off the xlr   but  no issues besides that 
this converts an xlr signal  for me  a shure sm57 mic  into a 1 4 male  i run it into a guitar pedalboard and then an amp    have no issues with performance but the converter is a little bulky especially once you clip a mic onto that   could be tight fitting into certain places on a pedalboard but works great overall 
i bought this xlr splitter to split the lead vocal from foh to my monitor rack   used this way it worked great and i never had any problems with signal loss or power issues   i began using a transformer isolated xlr splitter after we started playing bigger venues and no longer use this splitter   my only issue with the hosa y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short  so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when i plugged it into our lead singer s microphone   it would be great on a guitar mic or something that s close to the ground  or horizontally placed  but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand 
if i didn t think that purchasing these items from amazon i wouldn t do it  plus and more important i have worked as a purchasing coordinator for over 25 years now i know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not i can find even cables that i can t find in radioshack  best buys no where else  i have done a lot of purchasing not just for myself  but for business  these ladies and gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way  i would like to apply for a position with them regards ffsalsa
i was getting errors that my printer cartridge wasn t recognized and i sprayed some on the contacts and wiped off the excess with a paper towel   now it s working 
the only reason i give 4 stars is because i ordered 2 of these and 1 had the chord with it and one was missing the chord    i ordered both at the same time  other than that they are good hot mics   
as a freelancer  i occasionally work with a band that plays the midwest  performing on a near weekly basis   these are seasoned veterans who have no interest in gear per se and even less interest in brand cachet   it s all about money to them   i couldn t believe it when i first saw the group using these nady mics  even lower priced several years ago  and insisting they were as good as shure sm 57 s and 58 s   i still don t believe the quality of workmanship compares  any casual empirical test of build quality will prove as much    but these nady s handle the announcing  the vocals  and  when needed  the softer sounding instruments  flute  harmonica   and none has broken or quit on my watch i m a keyboardist  so mic power and fidelity don t affect me   i m only a trifle mortified when there are musicians in the audience who catch on to how cheap we are when it comes to the all important "gear component "  at the same time  my embarrassment  i confess  is not unmixed with a bit of demonic glee   after all  who s playing  and getting paid for it 
we bought this mic after seeing how our grandson was handling the mic that came with the karaoke machine thinking that mic would not last very long   i hope it does because this nady sp 4c is a very impressive mic for the price   we our using it with our roland cm30 cube and plan to use it with a roland micro cube also   i would have given it 5 stars if the cord connection to the mic was not a little loose 
i bought this cable for my band s live show setup   i bought it almost a year ago and still currently use it for the same application   while not the best quality cable  the length and price make it a good value for the money  especially if you re buying several at a time   i don t use these cables in the studio but for live  they re fine   i d recommend this cable if you re on a budget and looking to buy several at a time   if you re only going to buy one  i d look into canare or mogami  they re a little bit more expensive but easy to get and worth the price 
if they re used for live performances they will not last very long  good for the price  i need to resolder the ends after a concert though 
i bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage  it works for that  it s a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables  and that makes me a little cagy about its durability  i tend to use it for cable runs where i don t expect a lot of movement  e g   running a cable to a mic stand  and save my better cables for the belt pack mics the jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell  and it really activated my allergies at first  i stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them  and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell  not everyone has allergies  so this might not be an issue for all folks  but i couldn t use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months they re cheap and they work fine  i haven t noticed any sound issues at all 
i ve had this cable for awhile and i m not too impressed with the quality  the plug and jack look cheap and the cable is thin  i use it at home on a practice mic and it hasn t had much of a workout  i don t think it would hold up long on stage at a venue 
the gain on this mic isn t the greatest  but for speeches and soft recordings  this guy can handle it all very well 
i have a few shure sm58s which cost more   i like the open sound of the pg48 but vocals seem to break up more at higher volumes than they do with the sm58s   i like this mic ok but the sm58 is worth the extra money i think  especially if you expect to push its capability 
4 stars instead of 5 only because this thing won t tune your guitar or carry your amp  i use this solo  in a duo with a bass player  in a trio with drums and bass  i have a regular gig at a medium sized club that is basically one large room  i use it through a pyle pro self contained pa into which i also plug my martin grp elec acoustic  the sound quality is excellent  the volume seems limited only bny what the pyle pro will put out  i would have no hesitation using this for bigger rooms with a full band and pa  i haven t heard a hint of feedback and the on off switch is a plus the 36 99 price might seem to good to be true but think of the things for which we are paying less for than we used to  i bought a 32&#34  toshiba flat screen for around 230 bucks  think of what that would have cost even five years ago or less  the same is true of a lot of audio gear  a lot of companies are bringing high quality elctronics and music to the market but it s great to have a company like shure make something so good and so affordable  they have always made a high quality product and now they have one that almost anyone can afford  i cannot recommend it strongly enough 
so far  i m very happy with this microphone  tone quality is fine and does everything i need it to do for backup vocals in my band  although a longer cable would be nice  it s great a cable and was included in the package 
it is so hard to get an honest review of any mike that isn t a shure sm58  this is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured  of course at least part of this reputation is deserved  but perhaps more for the durability of the sm58 than its sound  i have a couple of sm58s and a couple of pg58s  i was considering the sm48  but the pg58 has slightly better specs  and almost identical price the first thing i noticed out of the box was that the pg58 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier  it also has a different switch than the sm58  the metal screens protecting them aren t interchangeable  i then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical  i tried both mikes  one after the other  first with speaking and then with singing and playing guitar  and then i changed the settings  or more specifically  the effects and the eq on the pa  i repeated the experiment  speaking and then singing while changing between mikes here s what i noticed  the sm58 is slightly flatter in the mid range  the pg58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence  they are about equal on volume  the slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an eq or just ordinary tone controls  neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop i haven t tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice  as it s too time consuming and interferes with playing  it s difficulty to judge in those situations too  or at least awkward  but i have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference  except one person actually expressed a preference for the pg58  but that could be just the settings i looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side  the sm58 is a little flatter in response  especially at the high end  over 10k hz  and it picks up a few db before the pg 58  somewhere between 50 and 60 hz  however  since the human vocal range is generally between around 300 and 3000 hz  neither of these seems likely to have much effect  although the sm58 might be a tad more responsive for a bass singer i also tried out two different behringer mikes and a radio shack mike  the behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the shures  sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume  i tried out a behringer 2000xm and was impressed by the similarity  these mikes sound almost identical  the b 2000 and the shure sm   the behringer 2000xm seems to have been discontinued  though  and replaced with the 1800xm  an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under $50 i then plugged in a radio shack mike that was a spare backup  not even taken out for practice  the model number is 33 3001  probably also discontinued  this was an excellent sounding mike  with good volume  presence and tone i didn t have any other mikes to test in this side by side experiment  but i did reach some conclusions there is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones  with the shure sm58 held up as some unreachable standard  they are sturdy  and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable  at around $100  however  there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable  at lower prices  including the shure pg58  and most likely the sm48  though i didn t have any of those to test i wish more people would give unbiased reviews based on actual performance instead of condescension toward those who are either on a budget or looking for alternatives to the standard bearer  i m giving this 4 stars only because i haven t had enough time to give an evaluation of how this holds up in comparison to the sm58 
i bought this one to replace a shure 8900  it s a big step up from that one  i am pleased with it  the old one had a lot of handling noise  this one has a little but it is very good for the money i paid for it  my next one will be an sm58  but that will be awhile from now  i m very happy with this pg58 update december 2012the handling noise is definitely something to consider  it would keep me from buying another one of these  other mics i own don t have this problem to this degree 
i started with the shure pg58 and most recently acquired the shure sm58   i d probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a neumann or telefunken mic costing 5 g s simply isn t that much better than a nady mic costing 10 bucks   but with respect to the shure  i m less sure that the sm58 isn t worth 40% more than the pg58   perhaps if you have a sufficiently high powered and "clean" amplifier and have tweaked the eq settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice  the two mics could be mistaken for one another   it was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency p a  that led me to realize the pg58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the sm58   switching to the more common  admittedly more expensive mic  gave me just the extra gain i needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice  at least for announcements  p s  i notice that the head of the pg58 is larger than that of the sm58   since the rise of the "digital audio workstation"  who doesn t have a computer with free  included garage band on it    large  even gold plated  expensive looking but cheap mics are on display all over the place   despite appearances  when it comes to mics  size doesn t matter  except for appearances  directors of high school show bands will dispense those headsets that wrap half way around the face  knowing that the girls in the front line think they re cool  they look just like madonna a or janet s headgear   some of the best mics are tiny  with an opening the size of a pin hole 
i use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets  it works as well as most mics and is more durable than most  i have used this in the studio when nothing else was available and it worked fine  as long as i run sound for a living i will keep some of these mics 
considering that the sm57 was introduced to the world in 1967  a year after the shure sm58lc shure sm58 vocal microphone  i guess the 58 gets batman status  relegating the 57 to that of robin  but that s not really a fair assessment considering the 57 and 58 were developed at the same time  and except for the 58 s acoustic foam lined cage pop screen  the two mics are identical electrically the sm  studio microphone  57 was designed to begin it s life in a recording studio  as a dynamic microphone used to mic the ever increasing volume of rock and roll amplifiers  drum kits  etc  in that capacity  it had no use for the pop screen of it s cousin the sm58  still one of the most sold vocal mics in the world to this day  so the sm57 slimmed down and even though it s still a fine vocal mic  you ll see it used mostly mic ing instruments  which it excels at one of it s long time and most important roles has been the official podium mic for the white house  a pair of sm57 s is always seen on various white house podiums for press conferences and there is even a vip bundled kitshure sm57 vip dual microphone kityou can buy for this exact type of use the sm57 is an extremely rugged mic  built to tough standards and can take lots of road abuse  that s one of the things that makes it popular with touring bands and sound companies  and on top of that  it s just a great sounding mic for the price there is a performer seriesshure beta 57a microphonethat looks very similar to the sm57 but the beta 57 has a different mic capsule and transformer and sounds different  so make sure you try before you buy bottom line is the shure sm57 is one tough road mic that sounds awesome and is not overly priced  a best value for sound companies  home studio recordists and touring musicians 
this mic is well made  heavy on the mic end    however  i have yet to try it with my multi track studio 
it is not a bad mic for the price   if you want a real good one with studio quality mic it would cost over 600 bucks  but it is no comparison to a studio mic since i have worked in a recording studio  now  you need to decide what you want  getting a studio mic alone does not give you the result you are looking for  it is like having hd tv and bd player but playing an ordinary cd  you would have to compliment the mic with many other products like a studio quality mixer  speakers and so on  if you are a home or hobby user  then go for this mic  this mic is quite good for its price  i would probably say  it exceeds your expectations arrived as promised in a frustration free packing  also  make sure you buy a foam mic hood for the mic to save it from unwanted dirt and spit the only reason i did not give 5 stars is   mine had a little dent on the body   may be due to transportation  but it has nothing to do with the function but just the looks 
how do you review an sm58   i ve used these most of my life  and will continue to  very durable  i got this to replace the same  a 20 year old  rusted   dented grill 58    i also use a d5  akg   same price  and a line 6 wirelesss  but the 58 is always reliable first choice or backup 
the first rule of microphones is that  "no one microphone is perfect for every purpose "  rule two is  "experiment with different mics in different applications to find your signature sound "  i ve used shure sm58 s along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968   i primarily used them for broadcasting and recording spoken word content but i have used  and still do use  them for singing some back up vocals the sm58 does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use   some people  me included  actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic  the shure sm 57   the sm 58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice   for example  anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the sm 58   people with softer or weaker voices will want the sm 58 the sm 58 is highly directional and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect  which means the bass increases the closer you get    this mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away   the reason so many singers think you are supposed to shove microphones practically inside your mouth is because the ball type shure vocal mics require you to get them very close or they don t sound right   on the other hand  the sm 57 sounds best several inches away from the user s mouth and works fine up to 12 inches away   while the sm 58 is certainly the number one professional pa vocal mic  there are precious few other uses for it because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source has to be very close before it is picked up clearly   it works ok for conga drums and the like  but the sm 58 is about the last thing you d want to use to mic a sax or guitar   personally these mics are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice  but for some people they sound great   the live vocal mic that works best for me is the shure sm 57 with a windscreen   however for other people the sm 58 works better   it depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do   if you have a very deep voice  the sm 58 might be the second best choice after the sm 57 which has a better low frequency response one certain advantage of the sm 58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability   this mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying pa squeal   another advantage of the sm 58 is that it is still available  at a slight extra cost  with a built in on off switch   the sm 58 s ball shaped grills are very sturdy and even if you should dent one you can get a replacement which screws right on for about ten dollars   i ve seen sm 58 s dented  rusty  dusty  smoked up  spit into  with pieces missing and slammed into a hardwood stage with the full weight of a boom stand adding mass to the fall and yet i ve never seen but one stop working and that malfunction was due to an on off switch that got dirt in it all the pro line shure mics are top quality   the pro line shures also hold their value well   if you buy one and decide you don t like it  you can get about what you paid for it on ebay   i would compare as many mics as possible before buying one   senneheiser s evolution mics sound really good too and are worth a look  the sm 58 will be the number one on stage vocal mic for the foreseeable future because most people follow the crowd instead of actually trying out different mics and picking the one that works best for their particular voice   these things are so durable that even if they stopped making them today they d still be around for another 20 years at least 
this mic works better for some people than others  that being said it is the first mic i put in a lead singers hand upon meeting them  if it doesn t sound good then i try something else  i have no complaints it is my go to mic 
i bought two microphones  a akg d5 and sm58   i like akg d5 a little better than this because the vocal sounded a lot clearer and crisp on the akg the sm sounded muted compared to d5 without any sound modification out of box   the output is also a little less sensitive than the d5 however i like the look of sm58 and it seems to be extremely durable 
in the immortal words that john cameron swayze used when hawking his timex watches during the early days of live television  the shure sm58 vocal mic fits perfectly into that same category before i found a career as a film and television sound recordist and mixer  i played in rock bands and did live sound mixing  one of the very first mics we truly fell in love with was the sm58  introduced by the shure brothers company in 1966  the sm58 quickly rose to become the industry standard in rugged road mics that actually sound good to the ear and are nearly indestructible the mic capsule is of cardiord  heart shaped  design which helps reject sound from either side  there is a 4k bump in it s frequency which helps vocals cut through stage noise  construction is rugged  frequency response is 50 to 15 000 hz  and the capsule sits internally on a foam shock mount to help isolate it from handling noise we used to joke about the sm58 in that if you needed a hammer and you couldn t find one  just grab one of these  they are that tough  i ve seen some of these on the road that you couldn t believe still worked  but they did and sounded great the cage style pop screen gives the sm58 not only it s distinctive look  one that influenced many other mic brands from the day it was introduced  but it s part of the functionality  internally lined with a layer of acoustic foam  the cage helps keep vocals pops from getting to the dynamic mic element  as a frame of reference  theshure sm57lc shure sm57 cardioid dynamic microphoneis the same exact mic and capsule  but without the pop screen shure also sells a performer series mic  theshure beta 58a supercardioid dynamic microphonethat looks almost identical to the sm58 but uses a totally different mic capsule and transformer and has a different sound so try before you buy the shure sm58 is still considered the industry standard of live performance mics today and for the price  they really are a good deal 
there are plenty of flashier   prettier   modern er looking or more nostalgic looking microphones out there   its all just so much marketing garbage  these mics are the best mic for the buck out there   anyone who claims to be able to tell the difference between this and far more expensive ones is blowing smoke up your a   
the mic is well made  heavy on the &#34 mic&#34  end   but i have yet to try it with my pop filter and multi track studio 
i use this cable for small home recording projects  i do not take the cable around to gigs or shows  as i am pretty sure it wouldn t last longer than a few months of heavy use  the sound quality is fine and the metal connecters feel a little bit flimsy  if your looking for something that is cheap and will do the job  this is your product 
pay a couple bucks more and you get one from a brand like audio technica and you know it s going to withstand the test of time   mine is working fairly well but the attachments are loosening so who knows what s next 
the product feels a little on the "cheap" side  but definitely does the job the way it should  so that s all i care about  it was cheap  and came fast  i recommend it 
this was one of two i purchased  also bought the 25  length and used them on an assignment recently   they fit my rode mic nice and tight  other cords i have bought didn t and the sound quality is excellent  if amazon allowed a link i would give you a link to a video i just finished on the independence of the seas   go to my website and look for it   ipa impress dot com
not much to say other than it s a good cable  good solid connections with no play  after consistent use  it s going strong 
no complaints  it s quiet enough and the price is right  is it a monster cable  no  but it doesn t cost as much either  i ve used this on lead vocal tracks into a studio condensor mic for professional album sessions and it was fine 
i purchased this to connect a sennheiser e825 mike with guitar amps  this requires  of course  the addition of a 1 4 inch adapter plug  the cable itself has worked perfectly and proved both durable and of a suitable length at least for jamming with friends and playing in small venues  recommended update  i marked this product down one star after a connector fell apart during what i regarded as relatively light duty  the set screw fell out and could not be found  i ve had similar problems with other pyle products  if you buy them  i recommend tat you get a micro screwdriver set as well so that you can tighten te connector screws before you have a similar xperience 
good quality rack screws that come with rubber washers to protect face of equipment   arrived ahead of estimated arrival time which is always nice 
hey  it gets the job done and that s all i can ask for   i tried several "cheapo" pedals  and this one was my favorite of them all   while some had better casings  metal instead of plastic   at the end of the day i m looking for a good sound  not a pretty pedal board   the pedal seems solid enough  it doesn t take up much space  it sounds great  and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come and  if you are like the typical musician  you are looking for something that s not going to break the bank 
hello musicfriends   this is built cheap but sounds great  good controls too  for me in the studio songwriting  its perfect but i would not exactly go on tour with it      there is something about the knobs i still love  even if all my other digital units have a tremolo hidden in it    may be  the age thing   
it sounds great   nice and warm and lush   one of the better trems i ve had the pleasure to use   however  i hate the plastic housing  and how the input output jacks are located   i don t have heavy feet  so it will probably last a good long while on my board  but i really wouldn t want to put too much weight on it 
the title says it all   i got it for $16  free shipping with amazon prime   which is cheaper than my local music store   i keep it on the head of the guitar  and it is easy to add  move  remove   with the trigger type release  it makes it one of the easiest quick change capos i ve used   it feels sturdy enough  lightweight aluminum    and best of all    it works 
a couple of bucks more than dunlop   which i have not tried  i own a couple wish they were cheeper i would have one in each case  but it works fine  and is well made   arrived on time  enjoy
like this camo capo s simplicity and its unique color   my friend got a new one after seeing me using it  but his is a bit shorter than mine   mine works both uke & acoustic guitar  i have no problem to use it on single hand   as the manufactor suggests for its duration  i don t clip it on the guitar when it s not in use    
i have had one for two years and no complaints  needed another for my travel guitar   the lever arm is coated with a soft plastic sleeve which protects the neck  the spring is firm and in 2 years has not given up any tension  finally on the string compression side the material is firm yet supple   i take particular caution to make sure that i don t leave it on anything that would indent that material permanently   
i currenty use two types of capos   the kyser one and shubb capos   both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses the benefits of the kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo i ve come across  doesn t require tension adjustment  and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use   the primary benefit of the shubb is that it has adjustable tension  and second  it s smaller  the main drawback of the kyser is the lack of adjustable tension   because it s designed to work across the fretboard  it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets  causing frets to wear faster over time   because of this i prefer to use the kyser on my less expensive guitar and the shubbs on the guitar i baby 
got what i needed   a basic capo for a good price   the tension is a little tighter than i d like  but works for me   covers all strings  and depresses them fully   i don t use it often  so i can t speak to its longevity  but good for me 
i don t believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo  but this one is quite good   for those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use   it does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built   it is as with all capos   important to take it off when not in use so the "rubber" does not get grooved   this is just good common sense   if this lasts a couple of years i will definitely purchase another 
it s a capo    nice fit    yet  sometimes i wonder if it fits too tightly  as when i use it  and of course the strings are tighter  sometimes i feel that playing with this particular capo makes my strings too tight   yet  it is a capo  structured very well 
good strong spring and good strong materials   the only improvement i would make is the clear protector that holds behind the neck   the protector needs to be longer   as the protector ages it slips off the end   if it had more surface extended from end to the base where it pivots it would help 
i have owned several of these over the years and own a silver colored one presently  the price is right for these  and they work just fine  my only real issue is that sometimes  they will bunch or bend strings when setting them on whatever fret you re going to bar  thus producing a sound you weren t looking for  some of the higher end capo s counter this by having screws and such rather than a spring  however  like i say  these work fine with a little care and attention to their placement on your fretboard  and are from what i can tell  the most popular model on the market 
easy to use capo  good strength   holds the strings down well   not sure that it s as good as the g7th capo  which i still find is the best for holding the strings down evenly so that they stay in tune  but the kyser is much cheaper and does a good job 
i really like my capo  the blue looks good with my light natural finish accoustic  and it works as it should  however  i feel like it deserves 4 stars simply because it could be a much more robust product  for example  i think the bottom part of the clamp should be a little longer  and rounded  the back side of a guitar neck is rounded  after all   the spring could definitely be tighter   i do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough  also  the design is fairly nice  but it s mostly aesthetic   it s not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily don t get me wrong  this is a rather good product  and it s priced about right  it just isn t a high end product 5 star perfect 
these martin strings  m170  aren t bad  they just are not the sound i was looking for  i ended up like the ernie ball earthwood extra light instead  the martin s are little shallow on the low end unlike the ernie ball  other people will love them though  they are easy to play 
martin makes great sounding strings   i decided to use light martin strings   12  because they sounded louder and better  and i could play them just as easy as the lighter strings 
this is my third pack  the 1st pack has been using for two months  the sounds are rich and full  and the feels are still good   i broke the high e on the 1st attempt of restringing  and luckily i had bought 2 packs at the same time   so  i want to keep a completed pack for back up   i have been fingerpacking for quite long time recently  sometime  i will practice for 4 5 hours+ until i m tired for the session   i have used light steel strings on my acoustic  but these ones are easier for fingers even just tiny lighter 
these are okay strings for the folk guitar             nothing special but the price isn t out of the world either  good buy for the money  tried them on a gibson j50 and they seem to do good 
i love these strings   i bought a set awhile back for my ovation  but never used them   then i came into possession of an old yamaha acoustic guitar which was pretty beat up and needed new strings   i put these suckers on there and wow was i impressed   even that old beater guitar sounded great and played easily with these strings   so    i bought another set for the ovation this time 
i bought this pick holder because i hate putting a pick between my strings to hold it and because you can t play with a pick in your strings  i originally thought this thing would be kind of large and go all the way across the headstock  boy was i wrong  the picture is misleading   this thing is tiny and barely goes across three string  it wedges under neath two strings and you can put two picks  maybe more if they are thin  into the wedges on top  stays in place well and is very convenient only negative is i don t know how long it will hold up  i think maybe a thicker rubber rather than this foam rubber would have held up better  i can see this thing eventually losing tension in the pick holder wedges and dropping picks 
i love the idea that you don t need a pocket in your strap or elsewhere to store your pick  further it will not add something else to find loose in my pants pocket 
i m using this right now on my acoustic and it does its job in respect to holding your picks  it was smaller then i would have pictured  but it still is a good product  it can hold light to heavy picks and its super easy to put it and take it off  only problem i had was that it moves a lot when putting my pick back in  besides that  its highly recommendable to anyone  i will definitely pick up more for my other axes 
not too much to say  it s made out of foam  made to slip between the strings  made to hold two picks   i have several of these  for acoustics and for electrics   my son lost one before during a performance on stage so it is not that secure that it won t be dislodged  still  it does stay on majority of the time   i do recommend this   my son s guitar teacher calls this a "fancy little pick holder" and i ve had people ask where to buy one when they see it for the first time   one must also be careful  my son lost one of these so i know it is a possibility of it falling off   he lost it after performing in a play on stage please click yes if my review have been helpful to you  it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews  and leave a comment if you have any questions  i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help 
i use this to hold my picks on my acoustic guitar  got tired of losing picks in mid jam  digging through pockets  scavenging for another pick  now it s right there 
this thing does just what it was supposed to  i use it on my practice bass since i use any type of picks on that  and it does just what it is supposed to
i bought one of these to try on my asher junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick  worked  but it was difficult getting all three picks in one wedgie so i ordered a second one  between the two of them  between the 2nd 3rd and 4th 5th strings up next to the nut  works pretty good holding these types of picks  which admittedly  the wedgie was not actually designed for   liked it so much i ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass  the bass version   only down side i see is    they do seem loose like they could fall out and i doubt the picks will stay in place when i case my guitar  haven t tried it yet   but otherwise  worth the price and a good doo dad to have around  especially if you have a lap steel and need a place to stick your finger picks on the guitar itself  real help to me staying organized   
i had been learning on a squier for about six months and really wanted a better guitar  after doing research  reading reviews  and checking it out in a guitar store  i chose this one it s much easier to play than the squier  and it has a better sound  like the squier  but not as bad   it gets a little buzzy on the top strings  i suspect it might need to be adjusted  but i don t have a clue as to how to go about it it s also a good choice for women  i m a small woman  and i really like that the neck is smaller  it s also fairly lightweight overall  i m happy with my choice  a guitar tech told me it s the best guitar out there under $500  maybe  i expect to be happy with it for a few years before i upgrade again 
i bought it 3 years ago here at amazon and i couldn t be happier   this was my first electric and after over a year of owning it  i got a way more expensive fender strat and i still prefer how this epiphone feels  it is really lightweight  a lot more that even other les pauls and the distance between frets is smaller than the one in other guitars i have tried  this makes it very easy to play  it stays in tune and it looks really really lovely i like it so much  that i decided to add a pair of slash s alnico iis on it  that cost more than the guitar itself  this only made it sound incredibly awesome and improve the sustain  good ol  crunchy bluessy rock call me cheap if you want and i wouldn t care  this is one of those items that makes you wonder  how come there s others way more overpriced and just don t find a way to justify that a "real" gibson les paul will sound $800   $1000 better it wasn t until recently  after 3 years   i estimate somewhere around 1000 hours of heavy use  that it started fretting and that s why i gave it only 4 stars  but what would you expect from a $200 guitar      i m sure this can be easily fixed by any guitar tech and it will continue been the sweet tone machine it has always been   if you re learning  looking for a first electric or just want a "practice" axe that will not dissapoint you  just go ahead and buy it  don t give it a 2nd thought and do it 
purchased primarily for rocksmith and it works very well for that   still learning how to play  but like the feel of this guitar   looks great and plays great   was packaged very well   only needed minor setup adjustments  i would recommend getting strap locks 
a friend showed up at our monthly guitar club meeting with this and i loved having an on off switch right at my fingertips  genius i bought 2 immediately  the shorter one goes from my guitar to the pedal board and the longer one from the pedal board to the amp  works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or ears two issues to consider  the right angle plug was a mm or 2 short of being able to stick into my tele and my takamine  it would not seat properly and would slide out  i had to turn the cord around and use the right angle on the pedal board side  where it worked  but now the switch is &#34 down there&#34   i don t think planet waves is the first connector that i had a problem with that so i dont blame them  but maybe stick with the straight jack if you are not sure  second issue is simply that these little button switches are fussy  you have to make sure you have it in the right position by looking at them   feel wont do   if you see the white edge they are &#34 quiet&#34  
i love this cable  it is perfect for making guitar changes without noise  the cable itself does not seem quite as good quality as my other planet waves cables but it is still better than most others  the switch is easy to use 
i like the product a lot  for me  the only problem is the time of the "sustainer effect" it is not so long as i thought  i though it would be like the piano s sustainer  but it s a good pedal effect  my guitar get a good sound with the "attack effect"  thank you 
as several of the previous posters astutely mentioned   you will need a noise gate to use this pedal   i completely agree with that  and it will sustain your notes  it will actually raise the volume to make them sustain  but you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up  the only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate  i use the ns 2 when i use my chain of pedals  that said  this pedals has some wonderful uses  every note will have the same volume  you can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume  you can set it to sustain for days  again  you will need a noise gate  there is nothing transparent about this compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors  but none of them are as "active" as this one  perhaps that s the price you pay for what this pedal can do  i recommend messing with it quite a while  you can do some incredible funk  jazz  metal vibes out of it 
the boss cs3 is right for me  i have been using it with excellent results  i have many compressors  line6  mxr  behringer  digitech  and although i alternate their use the boss stands out on many rig configurations  it can feel a little bit overcompressed sometimes but in general a very good product  i highly recommended it as your main compressor  if you dont like it probably you dont know how to configure it  good luck 
it really pains me to give anything but a 5 star review to a boss product  since i m such a big fan of their product line and build quality overall   those compliments apply equally to the cs 3 compression sustainer   and it does do the job reasonably well without me having to worry about putting a less reliable brand in my signal chain however  there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know   the two most common complaints that i see are that it adds "noise" to your amp and that it changes the tone a bit   the former complaint is probably true  though if you re enough of a hobbyist to use a compression sustainer  you re probably already contemplated using a noise gate suppressor  such as the boss ns 2   problem solved as for the latter complaint  changes tone   that s also true  but it s not necessarily a bad thing if you like the tone that results   the whole point of the cs 3 is that it s supposed to cut out the extremes of your tone and sustain it   this can result in a muddy  "neutered" tone  though you can play with the tone and other settings to help it   i also find that with the settings all at 12 o clock  the output is too quiet compared to other pedals at default settings really  while boss pedals are considered to be "expensive" compared to many of the other effects out there  the cs 3 should really be viewed as a "budget" or "entry level" compressor  when you consider that most of the quality compressors are either in rack units or something like a keeley compressor costing north of $200   the best thing you can say about the boss  even compared to the similarly priced mxr options  is that the cs 3 gives you a great deal of control over your compression for a reasonable price   the biggest negative of the pedal  in my opinion  is that the resulting sound might seem a little too   compressed but there are a lot of things you could do with a cs 3  and it works best paired with other pedals  chorus  delay  some distortions  that you re trying to smooth out   ultimately  it s a pedal that could have been better  though there aren t too many significantly better alternatives until you get north of $100 anyway 
think of this as an artist s tool   and for every job there is the  right  tool   is this the best distortion pedal   that really depends on what sound you are trying to get and what other gear technique you are using with it   if you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles   it will not make your 15 watt solid state ibanez soundblaster amp sound like a raging orange rockerverb and it will not make single coils sound like emg 81 85s   but arguing over what pedal is  best  is like two painters arguing over what color is best used to paint a sunrise   this pedal is good for a tight kind of distortion  but not so heavy that you can do modern metal if running into a clean amp   if that makes any sense  it it doesn t make sense  there are ample youtube reviews you can check out before pulling the trigger   it has been used by professional players like steve vai  joe satriani  and kurt cobain  it is a professional pedal used by professional musicians   it s built like a brick and durable as all get out   i found mine used for $20  but the new asking price is fair  i would like to see boss start using true bypass instead of the buffered bypass they use  but admittedly i don t detect any tonesuck with it   i ve run mine into a tube amp on the verge of breakup and it can really get things cooking   it also takes an overdrive or sustainer pretty well to bump the gain and get some singing leads   with the exception of  modeler  type pedals from companies like tech 21  i do not think that any dirtboxes  this included  perform optimally when run into a solid state amp   so if you are not happy with the way it is distorting your marshall mg  the problem is in your amp 
this is a distortion pedal  it will give your amp a boost for solos and turn a clean amp into a dirty girl  it s pretty harsh in tone   kind of a white noise distortion  the ds 1 does not warm up the tone in your amp  you can dial the tone in  but it s a pretty harsh sounding that said   the ds 1 does exactly what i wanted it to  my amp gives me a nice warm crunch  classic rock style  the ds 1 gives me the 80 s metal and punk rock sound i wanted  and it does so flawlessly it took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the ds 1  it s boss  so it will last forever th only drawback is that it s an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere  usually amazon catches up with that sort of thing  but word to the wise  don t pay more than $40 new for this thing 
this is a little more expensive than some other brands  but i think it sounds great and it s way more durable than a plastic pedal i m pretty new to electric guitar so i m not really a distortion and tone expert like some other reviewers   to me this this sounds better and is easier to adjust than my modeling amp  so i think it s a good purchase 
there s some element of nostalgia with the ds 1 that i ve just never understood   i know they re cheap   i know they re incredibly durable  as are all boss pedals    i know everybody had one or tried one at some point  and kurt cobain  apparently  used them with his fenders but i also know that i ve almost never been happy with the tone i get when i step on the pedal   it s incredibly thin and harsh  and lacks proper sustain  even cranked all the way   i ve used it on marshall solid state amps and vox tube amps   fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers   you can mess with the tone and dist dials all you want  but there has to be dozens of other affordable pedals  and even on amp distortion  with a richer  deeper tone coincidentally  i also used the boss os2 overdrive distortion for many years  which is supposedly merges blends a ds 1 with an od 1   that pedal isn t ideal either  but if i turn the knob all the way to "distortion"  it s a much better tone than i ever got out of a ds 1 then again  it is very dependable and usually only $40  or less   so i can t really give it a bad review because it probably does belong in everyone s collection   that just doesn t mean you ll want to use it all the time 
good metal distortion tone with bags of sustain but sucks a lot of tone  most metal pedals do  and is moderately noisy  if you are looking for classic rock sounds you won t find them here  can get muddy at times but there are plenty of settings to tweak to get the sound you are looking for  i find it useful for high gain leads and palm mute rhythms but note definition is not so good with chords  for the price this pedal is a good deal though 
i ve had this for about 11 years now  even with some of the newer metal pedals on the market  this pedal still sells well  not to mention  it s probably also one of the most modded pieces out there  any number of mods can be found online to change the sound  they re usually on the side of improving the stock tone  which i m happy with i ve always liked the parametric eq on this pedal  the variable midrange allows me to get marshall or mesa flavors  for most metal hard rock music  the gain range is enough for me  if i need yet more gain  i punch it up with an overdrive  or a compressor pedal for a cleaner boost  even without a boost  i can use it for death metal  i think if you play the tighter  more technical styles  it s better not to have too much gain anyhow 
to be honest  i was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to megadeth s first album kimb  so far i havnt got a perfect setup on it yet  but ive got close enough to it  this pedal is great  only a couple notes i should make about it  do not buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock  or just rock in general  this pedal is for metal  the battery drains like a mf  i dont understand why  the only possible explanation i can think is that i leave it plugged into guitar and amp  but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its turned on  i prefer just to get an ac adapter and not use batteries  other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal 
first of all i want to say i love a tube amp distortion   overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be   i run a randall g3 hybrid amp and it destroys any solid state i ve used or heard   for recording i use a peavey 5150 and its so sweet   tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard recently i started playing with a band that required a dirty tone that i felt like could only be achieved through a pedal   there is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals  i used the dod death metal for years when i first started playing   however  there is a downside   go cheap and you get a piece of crap that makes your rig sound like an old am radio  if you want something that sounds pro quality your going to shell out at least $250   quality dist  pedals are not budget friendly i chose the mt 2 because i know boss makes a quality product and it was the pedal the other guitarist was using   it gives a variety of sounds   it can be set up for an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones   the controls make it very tweakable and i have gotten a load of very nice sounds out of it   read the included book  look up some mp3s over videos online and check out other guitarists  settings   it will help you tame this pedal into what you want   perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot   there are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more useful i ve seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz   i must say learn how to shape sound  spend time dialing it in to your rig   within 10 minutes i was pleased with the mt 2   i used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick  heavy distortion with a good response i say the mt 2 is worth an investment if you re looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal   surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board 
this is a great pedal i picked up used  they can be had cheaply on the used market  i actually use it with both an acoustic electric guitar to get a little distortion and the bass guitar for some grit  the 2 eq pots on the front panel make it very versatile  enough to use with a cigar box guitar also the pedal can preserve bass signal and still be eq d for saturated distortion  the other reviews speak for this pedal both here and on other sites and one can see why it is so popular  i also other boss distortion pedals  like most people  i own a ds 1 and an md 2 which are both cheap and effective  i own a hm 2 heavy metal 2 which caters more to the traditional metal sound and i actually think this pedal is more versatile imo with different guitars where you may not want a strictly metal tone i also own an older 80 s hm 2 heavy metal which will run circles around the metal zone for classic thrash and speed metal tones and almost any other heavy distortion pedal that i could never part with  overall i like this pedal  but it cannot top the older legendary boss pedals 
this pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years   it really does have a ton of range  although it only does one effect at a time  so you d have to reach down and change the knobs mid show in order to get the other variations   my most commonly used setting was with the overdrive distortion mix knob at about 2 o clock  which produces a very professional sounding grunge type effect   if you want any of those 90 s sounds  excluding the heavier metal sounds  this pedal will definitely get you there 
for the money  i have no complaints   the enclosure  dials  and footswitch are all durable   not true bypass  but none of the boss pedals are   it doesn t suck tone   this pedal isn t the end all be all overdrive  but with asymmetrical clipping it fills a niche that ts pedals don t  you lose a little low end when it is engaged  but that actually works pretty well for leads  especially with humbuckers or amps with a looser kind of  classic  distortion encountered with el84s   as a stand alone overdrive  i prefer other pedals   but where this pedal really works for me is as a boost to other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp   you get singing  harmonic leads when it is dialed in right   like any overdrive  you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can get hissy while you are palm muting if you crank it too far   i am a dirtbox hoarder and i like to rotate the pedals and try different combinations   lately  i am running this into either the v1 cool cat transparent overdrive  timmy clone   very  very nice  or the behringer bo 100  which is a dead ringer for the boss blues driver  then into a tube amp that is dialed in on mild crunch  jet city combo or palomino combo    as with any overdrive  this thing will not sound very good  imho  running into a solid state amp   that s just not what it was intended to do  it was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but ymmv  because i m a cheapskate  and because these things are durable like bricks  i bought it used for $20  but it is well worth the new asking price 
it s yellow  its metal  its boss   if you want your drive sound to have definition this is the pedal to get   the best od i have ever owned   makes me want to see if my tone could cut board in half 
i bought this pedal used and have used it with both a fender tube amp and a marshall solid state using clean channels  i can get a variety of tones from it with different guitars  and reccomend it as a first overdrive or to add to a collection while i have several overdrive pedals  this one is good at giving some basic overdrive tones while keeping the amps low end  i can get decent tones from a telecaster and les psul by keeping the level and tone knobs below 12 o clock and adjusting the drive to taste the od sounds great through fender clean tubes and i also tried it with a bass guitar  with some adjustment of the tone and drive knob  the bass has an overdriven tone with a good drive the other reviews here prove this pedal is typical and iconic boss in build quality  i find the boss pedals good for their purpose and have mostly modded the ones i ve owned after some time  but i may keep this one as is and use it as a boost  these pedals last forever and i only paid $20 for mine 
as stated in the title  this adapter is what you need if you use your danelectro a lot and are going through too many batteries  you can now plug it into the wall  as advertised  it keeps electric current hum to a minimum and has functioned fine for the year or so i ve owned it  the reason i took off one star is because the wire is really thin and doesn t seem too durable  so because of this i have been very careful so it doesn t get broken  you might be able to find an off brand adapter for cheaper but this one is made for the honeytone so you won t risk ruining it 
my experience with crybaby is it has a great tone   more overbearing than the vox or cleaner wahs   but i know several people who have had problems with the switch  and i have watched countless others stomping on their crybaby in futile attempts to engage or disengage the pedal i actually use a bbe and vox since this frustration with my 1st wah   but i am not sure that i am giving up tone in exchange for the headache avoidance   i kinda think i am   the vox and bbe seem to have a brighter sound which is less "wah ed" if you will   it could be accentuated by me playing a strat instead of the les paul custom boogie combination i used with the crybaby 
my cry baby is about 20 years old and is the oldest pedal on my board  i have rewired it for true bypass and replaced the potentiometer to give the wah a broader range but it really doesn t sound any better  this pedal covers the &#34 white room&#34  by cream tone perfectly  i gave it 4 stars because it hasn t been maintenance free  the pot came loose and the switch had to be replaced but considering the fact that it survived several hundred gigs in smoky dives  i probably should give it 5 
it is a good pedal  but it just doesn t have the sound i was looking for  it is great for playing funk music  but for us metal heads  the wah is just too weak  for metal artists  i would recommend looking elsewhere  i am going to look into getting an ibanez weeping demon  or a morley  or whatever it is behringer is limping to the barn with these days 
i ve had my wah pedal for a number of years now  what i can say is that it has put up with a lot of use  no problem with the pedal itself  mechanically  however  the cheap rubber feet were the first victims of perhaps taking a few cheaper short cuts on producing the product  that is to say  the rubber feet began to come off in no time  if you mount it on a pedal board  you will probably remove those feet and this won t be a problem  also  the power supply that comes with it does a stellar job of powering the pedal  if you are like me though and place it in a pedal board where a unified power source makes sense and must use a different power cable  at least on my unit  the jack is not fitting properly leading to some serious shorts  those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat  what i have learned is that when using a different power supply to be sure the power jack is push all the way in  otherwaise  zap  other than those two issues  the power issue really no fault of dunlop s if you use the supplied power cable  its been a great pedal  a classic that will surely live on 
does what is designed to do easy to use seems sturdy should serve me well for years to come    was not too expensive for such good quality
i ve only been playing ukulele for about 3 years  so i m new to using a capo   it seems to hold tight 
costs about 2x as much as some cheap capos  and it s worth every single penny   this has a strong clip  yet does not damage my concert or tenor ukulele necks   it won t budge once you clip it  and it s low profile   made of metal  it should last a lifetime i took off one star only for one thing  the hand clip portion of this does sometimes get in the way of fretting because it sticks out from the neck quite a ways   some other capos  like this onejim dunlop 7828 russell banjo uke capodoes not have anything that you can hit your hand on when fretting   sometimes i try the kyser on the opposite side  away from me  the player   but  it seems to still hit my hand on some chords  just different ones   that said  i can work around it  and it s a lifelong capo of fantastic build and keeps those strings from buzzing at all on all my ukes  if one was to have large hands  as i do not  this interference may be even more of an issue to consider c ya   happy strumming   mahalo 
it s a good banjo capo   inexpensive  and it works well without squeezing the strings out of tune  end of story
in particular  i favor the dual design  why  if the need arises  it s possible to use a regular strap that doesn t have the button locks installed  i have two of the black ones on a 7 string ibanez rg7321  and laguna le200qbc guitars  i have spare straps for both guitars  and sometimes i lock those spares with the plastic dunlop discs i have some older bass guitars with similar dunlop locks  the standard version   two of which had locks installed in the mid 1990 s  and one from 2003 with the gold dd  all three of them have held up with no issues  i didn t need to re tighten the screws on those guitars until about two years ago  then again  i don t tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as     metallica    
so i bought these because being dunlop  i trust the brand  i dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky  the only problem i have is  they scare the piss out of me  its not a "tighten washer and nut" situation with what ive normally seen on strap locks  these have pegs that insert  its so hard for me to trust these  i always have 1 hand gripped firmly on guitar even if just adjusting the amp i clench my guitar  so scared that the little metal balls things will just slip  peg fall out and ruin a $500 guitar  i havnet had a single problem with this system yet  and i never hope that i do  but if it happens there will be an update to this  good product so far  just wouldn t recommend it  there is too much crap in the world to be worried about  strap locks shouldnt be one of those things 
the screws are too long for my very thin bodied gibson sg classic   i can not find shorter screws which fall into the pin so that the straplock will work either   the heads are all too large i believe i used these on my gibson les paul custom years ago  and they worked perfectly   not on my newer sg though  at least with the new screws it comes with fender start appears to take the system well  only time will tell 
yes  if your willing to swap out strap locks with originals these work fine   i did have a problem with drilling new holes into my guitars   but its explained what  size bit to use so wasnt a big problem   i tried not to drill on most of my guitars  some fit without drilling some did not  good luck   good price welll made  
i tried this model a few years ago  and i never had a problem with them  once i got it installed   but i went back to the schallers i had on my other instruments   i thought  and this has been mentioned by others  that it makes the strap stick too far out from the instrument  which i thought looked goofy   i also didn t particularly care for the push button release  and getting the locking part on the end of my thick strap was a challenge  these have a c clamp  not a nut  so there s no allowance for differing thickness  i also felt safer with the schallers  which hook onto the end of the guitar strap button and didn t depend on a spring loaded button to keep the parts together   as i said  i had no real problems with them  so if they look like they d work for you  great   as with all replacement strap locks buttons  you have to make sure the screws are secure in the button holes before you start jumping off of drum risers  dropped out of airplane  or what have you 
after receiving thedunlop dual design straplok systemalready installed on my gibson standard electric 7 36 lbs    and liking them  i decided to try installing them on my gibson studio electric  7 23 lbs    noproblem  just follow the instructions exactly and they will work perfectly i had no problem either installing them nor using them since the installation  money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground  besides safety i also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars  it s a nice convenience  if you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars if you are not sure if they will work on your brand guitar seek out an online forum and either search thatforum for the answer or join and ask your questions  you ve got a pricy piece of wood there and will wantto take care of it properly what i don t care for  but feel okay with because they work so well  is how big they seem to be  theydon t get in the way when being used but look almost out of place  that is why i chose black for mysecond set  helps keep the product s profile down a bit  other than that  the product works asadvertised    note  as of june 2014 i have installed two other sets and all are still working as expected  do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure  after repeated use the screws can come loose and therewill be trouble if this happens  do not use any glue in case you need to swap out the straploks in thefuture 
what s great about the dunlop design they work   the only thing you need to do is ensure you ve got them engaged properly at the time you attach your strap onto your guitar i e  just make sure you established a solid connection then go ahead and gig your rear end off without worry the design encorporates bearings that allow the strap to freely move around rotate on the post  which is exactly what you want   the schaller ones  see below  have a major flaw in them from my family s experience   we will never run anything other than this design going forward what doesn t work with the schaller design our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist have been using shaller style locks for a while now   every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body  i had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th anniversary american p bass   not good  my son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend  the problem with the design is there s a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that s screwed into the body unscrewing itself   we ve tried applying bar soap  petro jelly  and a spray can based dry lubricant     none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon we tried to make the shallers work but just could not   maybe we re all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us 
straplocks have been around for a long time  but now you can use the instrument with a regular strap as well  this dual design sold me on it  easy to install on the guitar  a little difficult getting the lock mechanism installed on the strap  still only took about ten minutes to do   the added security of knowing your 1200 dollar bass isn t going to hit the floor makes it very well worth the small cost of this item  
i use these on my basses and they do the job quite well   they are easy to install on the bass and the strap 
i like these straplocks  but they were a little tight to get on a levy s strap   i did manage to get it on   however  i found it was easier just to buy a strap for each guitar 
the dunlop dual design straplock system is a sturdy  fairly easy to assemble and easy to install alternative to guitar straps slipping off of instruments   the screws that are used to attach the straplok to the guitar are heavy gauge and pretty large  there s little chance that these are going to come out   the locking mechanism seems like it is secure and should require little maintenance   the only disadvantage of the dunlop system to schaller s system is that the the dunlop sticks out measurably farther from the guitar s body   ordinarily  it seems like this should be only the most minor of inconveniences   on an instrument such as a hofner "violin" bass  though  or any guitar with a strap button on the back of the instrument  this makes it difficult to hold the body of the instrument against your body for support   schaller s strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players   the dunlop straplok system is sturdy  should provide a long life of service  and can be found at a better price than several of its competitors   recommended for most guitar body styles
i know this is a great product   i ve had a set before   i have to knock off a star because a part was lost during shipping that renders the product useless   the product comes in a clam shell package   for me it shipped with some heavier stuff that impacted the package and let it open some   there are two retaining clips that slipped out and since the main shipping box wasn t fully taped up one slipped completely out of the box and is probably on the floor of some warehouse or truck somewhere   i found the rest of the small parts in the box and the larger parts still in the clam shell package but without the one retaining clip the system is useless the product is too inexpensive to bother with a return   if i find a retaining clip that will work  i do have one to compare with  then i can use it that said  i ll say again  the straplok system is a great product   i know  i ve owned another set for more than twenty years 
a little story to back these lock s integrity   i installed them on a korean made washburn wg 587v   incredible guitar after tweaking   i did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying   the strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder   the screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar   the screw tore through about a half inch of solid wood  and i epoxy all my screws in  before the strap lock broke   amazing nice  tough hardware   the only complaint i have is that you must use screws with small heads if you choose not to use the stock screws provided   easy to install  just unscrew your stock strap holder and screw in the lock holder   attach the lock to your strap and bam quick release system   fast to take on and off of your guitar i would suggest getting a tough  thick leather strap with a nice reinforced eye to install the quick release button in  cheap lightweight straps will eventually start to tear   also  the button can be a slight pain to get on certain straps i have now switched over to dimarzio clip lock straps instead of the leather straps with dunlop locks for many reasons and i am very happy  but this product is grade a  i always felt 100% secure with these straplocks   our bass player uses some expensive  and heavy  fender basses and he loves these strap locks 
i ve been using these fender straplocks over the last year fender 099 0818 300 f straplock chromethe problem with those is that they use screws to secure that part that is on the strap itself  and the screw will slowly back itself out and you get yourself a disaster  i ve decided to try these because they use a "dual" system  you can use the lock on your strap  or just use your "regular" strap without the locking mechanism  i ve only been using these for a week  but so far  i like them much better than fender s  i think i will replace all fender straplocks with these i do agree with the others on the fact that the screws are of lower quality  and the screw heads will strip if you re not careful  when i was installing these strap nuts  i screw in a half turn at a time  and applied lots of pressure so that the the head won t strip  if you can get over the installation  you got yourself a pretty good locking strap 
these are good if you have a few of guitars and got a favorite strap   buy alot of extra buttons i got allparts   seems really sturdy and well made 
i replaced the schaller strap locks on my strat with these  the schaller ones ground on the connecting hardware to the point where i had to oil them a few times a month or i d end up with an audible creak hands down i like the dunlop ones more  they installed in just a few minutes and the guitar feels very secure  no problems whatsoever  i just ordered my third set a few minutes ago i m a total convert   every new guitar i get is going to get a set of these put on it 
dunlop is not the best strap lock system because it s a pain to switch which way the lock is pointing and people complain that the button is easy to unhook while playing  i can see the merits of screw on locks  what with the ease of switching the locks  but these work fine for me 
i don t know if this is a common problem  but i have these on both of my basses  and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing  like metal does before it rusts  it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing  the problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn t just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose  and one time  the first time  i didn t notice and it actually fell out  notice i still like the product  this was just one of those things i think  so i would still recommend it 
i like this strap lock very strong very sturdy  keeps things in place   one problem   the coating will wear out in a short time  a few months  and if you never take it off it might rust a bit on the inside  this might make it a bit hmm i don t want to say hard to lock  but you d better make sure it is actually locked every time you fit it on by tugging on the thing to be sure  mine has un clipped a couple times because i didn t check  our climate is humid so it s rust friendly which could contribute to why i m having issues  however once clipped properly you shouldn t have issues  great buy
 i bought a ukulele  to give as a present   i knew the strings that come equipped  on new musical stringed instruments would be of poor quality so i purchased these martin strings as a replacement   i ve used martin instruments for many years  am fond of the make and quality of the martin products   this was an easy choice for me  there are other excellent strings available   this just was my choice this time 
great easily setup but some time i feel its not perfectly stop the p s  i don t know why but some time i have to keep distance for that issue
i m not very familiar with how pop filters actually work  apart from getting rid of unnecessary peaks when recording  i have noticed an improvement in recording quality with this pop filter on  i don t know how it compares to other pop filters though  but this one seems like it works for me 
what a difference a pop filter makes  i use on a condenser mic  it lets me get a little more gain input  clamps on easy and holds good  the flex piece holding the filter could be a little more rigid but does the job  i like the way it looks when mounted on the mic stand extension  it has improved the vocal tracks  just one more affordable improvement for the home studio 
great quality and construction  does it s job well  only complaint is that if the design were a little more streamline  these bolt on with attitude and are a bit heavy  overall  stays in place and does it s job well  a workhorse for sure 
when i bought these i was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording   once these are in position they work just fine  the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks   the device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it   the filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where i wanted it and to keep it there on the plus side  the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use 
it works as a pop filter should and is a huge upgrade over my make shift panty hose pop filter  what else is there to say 
filter works very well and looks professional  only problem i am having is that the clamp seems to work specifically with a mic stand or similar type structure 
this little guy has help me record with my apogee one voices and amps  to prevent air flow shock on diaphragm    wanna have excellent recordings  get one 
yes  you can make your own pop filter at home  but you don t want to   why else would you be reading this   besides  it won t look this good i ve purchased three pop filters thus far in the last four months   the most recent one i purchased was not this one   i wish it was   i thought i d try something different  just to see the differences   well  i can tell you that there are significant differences between this  and some of the others featured here the bottom clamp on this one features a rubber piece that grips the metal pole that you attach to   the competitors that i ve tried do not   if you do not have this rubber piece  any clamp will tend to slip down the pole and not grip properly   this is a huge mistake as this makes using a pop filter on a boom stand impossible   fortunately  nady placed this rubber piece on it s clamp so this has never been an issue the only complaint i have is the screen has actually popped out of the plastic ring a couple times   a single dot of superglue fixed that compared to the other pop filters i ve seen and used  this one is perfectly suited for any microphone and at a reasonable price you can t beat it and yes  pop filters are a must with condenser microphones   just buy one now  save yourself the trouble 
it does what it s supposed to do  it s as well made as most  i think  they all look cheap to me  unless you get a studio professional grade  the screen pops out easily  but it will pop back in  it works well for my home recording 
i read several reviews of pop filters on amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were   finally i just went with this one and i m pretty happy with it   it seems quite servicable   it is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough   the arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don t bump it   i guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it   i think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer i can blow on it directly  not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles  and i feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic so then  i m gonna keep it and use it  till it rots or gets lost 
though i d warn if you don t know about audio this does not mean you can place your mic right in front of you and have the pop filter magically de esse the whole thing  but between the pop filter and a slightly off center placement it seems to keep the majority of erroneous pops and esses s from making an appearance in any way 
works very well  keeps the popping to a bare minimum  easy to install  cleans in a flash  lightweight and works
i do a lot of podcasts and dubbing over videos  and after using this filter  the pop that occurs with p s and b s in the voice are basically gone  it makes your audio more professional when you eliminate these annoyances 
works well but wish it was a bit heavier and the construction was a little better made  but other than that works as intended 
for the price  this is one of the best pop filters  it easily clamps onto my stand and doesn t move around after i place it  however  there is one problem i ve had with it  it can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter  what i mean is that  if i pick up the mic  the arm will swivel away  granted this was caused by me dropping it once  but before it was fine  so for a good price you get a filter that works 
a needed accessory for any vocal recording  period  my only gripe about this model is why the straight bracket part needs to stick out so dang far  since you can bend the arm out in any position anyway 
good solid construction  it hooks onto the mic stand and works as advertised  i e removes the pops from vocal recordings 
this is my second spectraflex cable and i love them  i love their flexibility  options for colors and ends  build quality and price  i like to use quality guitar cables for a good sound but i don t need to spend a fortune on them to be run over on stage by roadies or ripped off because the cable costs more than some guitars do 
this is a pretty strong cable  i wanted something i can plug into my top loaded amp and the jack would stand out in case i m sitting on the amp  the angle does the job  seams strong   seams like it will last 
i bought two to run from my amp to a lone pedal effect that i use with my bass   the 90 degree ends go to the pedal and it makes for a non intrusive smart looking setup   i m pleased   i ve owned them for a few months now   no issues at all and they look good 
it is a fun little practice amp  and i agree with the praise it gets  the positives have been covered so i ll point out a few  minor  things i don t like first of all the power button is on the back  which is annoying  the rest of the controls are on top  why do i have to grope around the back to find the most important button  plus i keep it in a cabinet so i have to pull it out to turn it on and off next  i wish they d just name the settings &#34 clean&#34   &#34 overdrive&#34   &#34 distortion&#34   and so on  jc clean  black panel  brit combo and r fier mean nothing to me then there s another minor annoyance that the input is recessed  a 90 degree angle plug won t fit unless you run it around the back lastly  the amp is solid and rugged but that means it s heavy  not heavy like i can t pick it up  just heavy for something called a micro amp none of these are deal breakers  just things i find annoying  overall i have to say i prefer my vox mini 3 
this pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries   we ve used it on a couple of gigs an it worked well with the volume only half way up   we are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it   we are using an mp3 player for backup   the sound is not quite as clear as we get with our roland cm 30  so only 4 stars from me    the micro cube is a lot easier to transport and set up and it s nice not to have to load up cart to roll around   guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features 
tone control didn t work so it was returned   but it was pretty nice even though i felt the fret board quality is higher on my 900 gibson les paul but what can you expect   if i had to order it again i would pay 140 more and get the sg 400 which has the quality pickups   the sound is let s say    average   good beginner guitar  or a guitar that can be upgraded with new pickups   the bolt in neck didn t bother me but the sg 400 doesn t have that which is another reason i would step up next time   shape is ok   purely subjective   i like the solid les paul shape now a little better since it s more conservative   but the size is good and almost more comfortable than the les paul style   can t believe they can make a good guitar like this for only 160 bucks   also  even though i was tempted with the faded finish  the glossy finish is really nice   this guitar will make a player proud 
love the case nice and simple  it really look exactly the same as the picture  highly recommend to everyone looking for a case 
i do some guitar repair work and one of my customers needed a lp case  i have bought a lot of stuff here on az so looked at this one and had it shipped to him  he says its great so that is my review prices are always great on az and prime saves me money in shipping 4 stars is my tops  anywhere 
this houses your guitar and i have a couple humidipaks  in there because i live in a northern desert  not many frills to this bag  it does the job 
good quality bag for my epi lp  fit like a glove  in fact i wish they were a little larger to hold some accessories 
at &lt $20  this is a great bargain  but it is a very basic bag  it fits my les paul standard snugly and has back straps for easy carrying  these are also easily removed if they bother you  this epiphone gigbag also has a zippered pocket for accessories  holds a strap  patch cord  but not much else  and features nice looking graphics 
this is not my first guitar  nor am i breathless epiphone supporter shouting how this guitar is the sonic equal of taylors and martins  it s not  here s what it is  an exceedingly well constucted  amazingly playable guitar  fit  finish  feel and action were all very nice    sound on the other hand  let s face it  it s plywood all around  it sounds like plywood  but that doesn t distract from the fact that it s a great guitar for $100 bucks it s a fine &#34 first&#34  guitar  it s a great beach camping cabin guitar  leave it in your car to practice at lunch  leave it in the office  any guitar is better than no guitar    and this guitar is better than a lot of other entry level guitars seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box    new  premium strings do make a difference if your expectations are for a playable  rugged  affordable guitar you won t be disappointed  if sound quality is your primary concern  well    you are going to have to spend more than a hundred bucks to be happy for my desired application  this guitar was great    i m very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat 
i tried this but ended up going back to tortex   i like the satin finish on the tortex better and the way it bends   the ultex has a little brighter attack though and wears out less quickly   ultex sounds more like the fender celluloid 
these are nice  i like the 1 14 rigidity and these are just fine for me    you will wear them out on acoustics though if you are a more aggressive player as i am   once these are worn  as with most picks  they sound considerably different   much more grainy and tin y but that may be a plus for you   i also like the side edges for a real mellow and   or speeding picking style   they stay in your fingers well 
the grip is excellent  but i prefer the 1 14 sharps over these  these are sturdy and look like i won t be needing another set for quite some time
this product is excellent   cleaning is thorough and leaves no residue   made my little martin look almost as good as new 
i was looking for a sound hole pickup and this came as one of the best and found it to be all i expected  i use it for practice and recording myself  i really like it but for the price i wish it had just a bit more otherwise its perfect  i have it on my 1994 martin d 18  which has a big bottom end and no matter what it always sounds fine  i have had the pickup installed for four months and it is good 
these strings are very bright and full   they sound great for a couple of weeks and then get a bit dead   i haven t had any problems with breakage  just a loss of tone over time  seems faster than some other strings i ve tried  
these strings are great sounding  and great looking on the fretboard  because they are bronze  one issue i had  was the 5th and 6th strings were too big to route more than once through the tuning head  but it still wound up very nicely  i would actually say that you might want to get the extra light gauge  but it s probably just my tuning machines  they kind of suck 
i am not a connoisseur but nothing great about these strings   they have pretty good sound but they seem to die quickly 
arrived on time  packaged well  happy with purchase   they are your regular picks  will order again if needed  happy with purchase  hope you enjoy em   
i have tried few picks  textured  mallow color  and this bright green   i like it bright color that is very easy to found  and 0 88mm seems right for me to strumming on an acoustic guitar 
good picks  great feel and brings out sound loudly  mostly for electrics  i prefer the lighter sound of the acoustic but these work very well with my friends electric  fender 
i absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks  they are so grippy  i haven t broken a single one yet  they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio  so it s hard to loose them  but i still do  if you have like a child  nephew  niece  sibling  or parent that plays guitar or bass you can t go wrong with getting these for them  or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little fender picks that break if you strum a chord  and if you are lucky enough not to break them  they just slip out of your hands while you re playing  they are a little thin for rhythm playing however  and i recommend the  88 mm picks for that 
i have always used tortex picks  i like them a lot and they last forever  almost   these were a little thick for my tastes  the red ones are a little thinner and give better action for strumming and also for fast alternate picking patterns if you like a medium thick pick though  these are rockin 
this is the pick i learned to play with great feel  doesn t slip in sweaty fingers good tone  you can get plenty of use from one pick  as they hold up very well 
good deal 
ever since i started playing the guitar  i ve used the nylon dunlop picks  they re better in a thicker size  1 0mm or larger  but the  73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular fender pick  they re flexible and easy to pick with  but the biggest plus about the nylon picks is that they will not break  you d almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it    so one pack of them will last you yeeeeears also of note  the price keeps going up on these here on amazon for some reason    don t pay more than $3 4 for a pack of them  as you can get them at your local music store for about that 
i am a bass player so i like my picks to be a bit thicker and wider  i tend to play with fender 346 so i was pleasantly surprised when i found that this pick worked really well for me 
i would give these picks five stars  but i do have a couple of other types i prefer more   still  these are nice picks   so far i ve only used them on 12 string guitar  but i ll soon be trying them out on 6 string guitars 
cant go wrong with dunlop pick  they last and don t break  end up losing them verses breaking  this  38 mm is a bit soft for my liking  will go a size thicker next time~
i ordered these because i bought a variety pack of picks from musician s friend and there was one lonesome very thin celluloid pick in the pack  i loved how it quieted the strumming on my acoustic dreadnought  so i went on the hunt for very thin picks  the celluloid one fell apart quickly  so i wanted a better material these white nylon picks should last a lot longer  the non pointed end is all grippy  textured   so it doesn t work great if you like to use the more rounded corners of a pick  but it does the job and i like it  the pointed end is very thin and slides off the strings nicely  but you can still pick with it if you re combining picking and strumming i ll keep using thicker picks for picking only songs and for louder strumming  but for more mellow strumming and to keep from bothering other folks in the house  these are great update  i ve been using them for more than a year now  and they are pretty flimsy for picking notes in a mostly strumming song    but you can do it  this is still my favorite pick for strumming  hope this helps 
these picks are nylon  so each one will last you a couple of years  as long as you don t lose them    this is thicker than the  60mm  so you can dig into the strings a little better  but still a hair flimsier than the snarling dogs  73mm picks  i know  they re the same size  but trust me these are &#34 flimsier&#34    and the grip is ok  you can t go wrong here 
this nylon pick has great play feel   it is stiff enough to pick individual strings and still feels comfortable stumming chords 
ive been using dunlop nylon standard picks since the early 80s  they have never let me down  very comfortable in the hand 
i m an irish style dadgad guitarist   these picks cut through the string really nicely  and are great for driving rhythms   i m starting to lean towards the tortex  5mm  though    i think the roughness on the surface of the dunlops adds a little bit of scratch to the sound that i don t like   still  great picks 
i think many most guitarists are always on the lookout for new things and picks are and easy and cheap thing to try   my favorite picks for the last ~8 years are snarling dogs brain picks   they re nylon picks that have a raspy "cat s tongue" surface that makes it super easy to grip i ve also had a few of these gator grip picks for a few years now and i like them quite a bit  but they re not my favorite   i tend to use something around or just under 1 mm for electric and a bit less than that for acoustic   these picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them   sound wise i don t find that they re significantly different from any other pick   if they ever stop making brain picks these could very well become my #1 
this pick is great for strumming  some people are complaining about the grip but they are better than celluloid picks in that regard  if you are looking for the best grip you need to find a pick that has a textured grip 
i m glad i tried these  i wont order them again  i thought they might be a good alternate for my dunlop nylon picks  not really though edit  im nothing if not fair  my last review of these was in the context of my playing my strat or sometimes my 335  i stand by that review  however  now im playing my godin 5th ave and suddenly these picks are perfect  ive gone back and forth trying different picks with my guitars  in the end these are the picks i reach for when im playing the godin i will buy these again  i changing my review from  just okay  to "contextually perfect"  ok i ll add a star  your right i should add a star  there 
these have been my favorite pick for years now but  i must say that they are not real pointy and i have recently been trying some pointier pick and i m now on the fence   
i ve been trying to find a pick which combines a good grip  the right string resonance for strumming  and enough stiffness for accurate picking and these picks might be the closest i ve found so far for my style of playing  i m a naturally hard strummer so i want a pick that i can hold more loosely  strum more softly  and still get enough clarity and volume  i want to give them 5 stars but i think that would only apply if they were perfect for strumming and picking   they re very good for both but not quite what i would consider the ideal pick for me if one exists  if i were perfectly satisfied with these picks i would never buy any other picks  for now these are my preferred picks but i will keep experimenting with other brands and types of picks in search of that elusive ideal 
i always find it interesting the different opinions about products   some don t like the sound  others say these wear out in a day  really    do you play for 24 hours     some say that the grip is good   here s my take    for what it s worth   i ve listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars   round and flat wound strings   my general take is that these picks give a better  fuller  rounder bigger tone overall   compared to the tortex style pick material  1 mm for the tortex    it s a bit hard to determine if the sound comes from the material  thickness or a combination of both   also note  i play with the rounded edge  not the tip   so the grip in the center of these doesn t quite fit my grip style but it s still ok   i do find that these get slippery faster than the tortex materials if my hands sweat at all   i ve been subjective in my comparisons    but this is what i ve found so far   i find that they stand out  sound wise  for the guitars i m currently playing   the process of finding the "right" pick is never ending and changes over time   give these a try and let me know what you think 
these picks have a very unique shape and sound that have helped me play faster with a smoother tone unfortunately  these picks did not receive a five star rating because of their price and lack of durability   they wear down fast   mine are usually worn out after a day of use and i don t think i play particularly hard   at around $4 50 for six picks  these are some expensive pieces of plastic however  these picks are so full of awesome that i am compelled to pay a little extra   i will definitely be buying more 
i bought these wanting to try the nylon big stubby but was sent the lexan  clear purple ones instead  i wanted to mention this because the item description is vague plys pk  and the item pictured is nylon  i m still happy with the purchase these have the same picking dynamics as the jazz stubby but they give you a much larger surface to grip 
i ve been using these 2 0s as my primary pick for years now and i love them  the way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick  they re very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently you will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the pick s tip  when you first use them the business end is extremely pointy  sharp almost  after playing a bit  the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time  eventually  it really rounds out and you ll want a fresh one  i typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice  you won t care 
real nice guitar picks  it came in a 6 piece pack  they deserve the dunlop brandname because these things last a long time 
i like dunlop products i used the purple tortex 1 14mm almost exclusively until i met up with this jazz iii   and now my personal debate continues     i like a thick pick and this jazz iii is   i like tortex and this isn t but   i really like the orange color which makes it easy to locate if you drop it   i rarely and i do mean rarely drop a tortex pick but this nylon might get a bit slick at times they make 3 or 4 picks in this line with varying degrees of tip pointiness   i like the pointy model the others have round and rounder tips this is the new and improved jazz style pick and i am still trying to figure out if i like this or the trad fender jazz pick   or perhaps having a few slightly different picks laying around isn t such a bad idea after all 
i tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably  in fact  they were so good that i purchased ten more when i went back to the same music store  my favorites are mandolin picks like golden gate or grisman "dawgs"  the round side of the xh dunlop gels gives me a similar attack and a nice warm tone  i would recommend these to anyone 
if for some reason you re looking for a pick with a specific color  this is a nice set  the bright colors make them difficult to lose 
i have used the extra heavy picks for many years but am still searching for that perfect pick  its strong enough to play metal and some blues style rifts but not so strong it cracks and brakes  i do like the fact it wont turn to powder or fray while playing either but it does wear out fast when playing on heavy gauge strings 
they play well and hold up well never had one break  they are my second favorite pick  but this pick is better in some songs than my favorite 
for keeping your guitar picks where you can quickly grab them the dunlop mic stand pick holder is extremely efficient and useful especially when performing live always great products and always dependable i also own the guitar maintenance kits and the capo not one product has let me down yet my capo is 8 years old 
i put it on the boom of my mic stand  tight on some  not on others  i need to put a shim on it for some stands to keep the picks in place
