it hums  crackles  and i think i m having problems with my equipment   as soon as i use any of my other cords then the problem is gone   hosa makes some other products that have good value   but based on my experience i don t recommend this one 
i m a pro cheapo and i hated this thing  they re noisy  and the cables feel really cheap  gummy like  drop few more bucks and get something else 
received it in time  standard blister packaging but the cable stopped working after 45 days  since i was out of 30 days return time  sent an email to the manufacturer but no response till today 
these things are terrible  one wouldn t fit in my soundboard  another wouldn t lock in my mic  plain and simple    if your looking for crap that doesn t work    buy this 
this is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says  it distorts  you want something to make your guitar sound like junk  this will do it  why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me  this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hendrix would use  boutique and distortion are an oxymoron these things are built with heavy metal  it should last  i kinda hope it doesn t just kidding   you want distortion  you got distortion
here s the deal with this pedal  it is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money  in my opinion  for spending less than $100 for a distortion pedal  whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal  a few more bucks will get you the mxr badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it 
these came stock on my jackson kelly kexmg  all the other guitars i own have schaller buttons on them and i have one main strap i use for all of the guitars  i figured since the guitar came with them i would try them out  not twenty min later i was removing them and putting schaller buttons in their place  here the 3 major reasons i did not like them over schaller 1  bulky  they stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below 2  problems engaging  i would push them into the receiver and they pop back out  it wasn t until i forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in  schallers click in and you know they are ready to go 3  cheap  they just feel cheap  thin metal is used in comparison to the schallers  which have a very heavy and solid feel to them for a few bucks more i ll stick with schaller s  i have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail 
i purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good  looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless  does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter  i would have returned it but i completely destroyed the package getting it open  which oddly had staples holding it closed  
wind screen is way too big its bulky and to me useless  the screen came out  was thinking of glueing it back in but went to ebay and bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper that is much better   avoid this  
i got this for my boss loop station  but it doesn t work very well   i keep hoping i ll find something it does work well with   
long story short  this string set has a strong metallic character  which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much  many people might like it  but for me  absolutely noooooooo i have a seagull guitar  so by its nature it sounds mellow  warm and mild with stock strings  so when my strings wear out  i got this  now i feel like playing an emg bridge on my fender archtop s neck position  without the power that an emg pickup has to offer  yes  it is that bad  you can t do this to guitars like seagulls   bottom line  i recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar  if you have guitars like seagulls or so  definitely avoid this string 
another item never received but i would not use anything over  88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase 
this product is not what it seems  it has a cool name  but that s about it  it s a tool oil that stinks  i tried my best to get use to this product  but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time  after doing away with the fast fret  my playing has improved and i hardly ever have to change my string because of gook  not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty  i now use old english and my guitars thank me  my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me  you will too   
it just randomly pops off my bass  it s so slick that when you let go it the neck just goes straight down  i hate it 
years ago i used the clayton &#34 small teardrop&#34  picks  i couldn t tell from the picture  that these were full size  and i didn t check the size in the description   i still had a few of the small ones  so i used them as templates  to cut these down  i would have rated them higher  if i could have used them as is  it s my own fault for not looking at the specifications  i purchased two six packs of clayton teardrop picks  but found dunlop 423r60 0 60mm  orange  tortex small tear drop guitar picks  36 pack which are a lot cheaper 
total flimsy junk  it leans wayyy too far back  i ll be damned if i put my $1000 guitars on these things  on the other hand  chromacast makes one that s very close to this price  and i doubt that it could have been more for the money i paid in summary    do not buy this piece of junk 
   for something  but not a guitar   wasn t sure what to do with it so i now use it to mount a large cookbook  or notepad computer  so i can follow a recipe   it seems to work okay for that   just don t use this for guitars   an electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far  and the arms have no grip   this thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project   it may even give you aids   but probably not   however  animals could have been harmed in the making   but most likely  and in reality  it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner 
i bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone i was looking for on my 7 week old guitar  installed as usual and tuned them  they sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible  my capo could not even hold them  i set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking  when i looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off  i released the tension on all the strings as fast as i could and left it  i returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail  the body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now  use at your own risk        i personally wouldn t give a nickel for them 
this is an update to my original review because i have now fully tested two of these capos   i m truly surprised by all the good reviews here   i m not sure how it s possible   i ve already outlined below in my original review that these are not jim dunlop capos   i had purchased two  which i have now given away to student players as i cannot use them   i tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar   the e string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring  both capos had this very same problem when i received these capos  i noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual jim dunlop capos   the craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official jim dunlop capos   the rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand name printed anywhere on the product   as a professional musician  i need to purchase reputable brand name products because i can t afford to have my gear failing during performances   i have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand  and no measurable reputation   when i contacted the seller  they were not honest with me 
i know many people love the design  but i find it much too frustrating  you have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly  then snap it in  then turn and turn the screw  oops don t let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw  then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again  what a farce  this is the worst capo i ve owned  and i ve tried nearly every brand and type  yeah  i ve had people show me how to do it right  and i know to do it right  it s just wrong to have to spend so much time slipping it on  snapping it  screwing it in  screwing it off  having it fall off  forget it  it s garbage to me  also  while i m getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day  the last thing i want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw  it s actually slightly painful to the fingers  momentarily  but why have to deal with that    to work with  this design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it  the only good thing i can say about it is looks durable no thanks 
i bought this hoping to use as intended  angled into guitar & straight into mixer  wrong  have to use it the other way around     sad 
only lasted 2yr   i have a lot of cheaper cables that get more use abuse than this one that have outlasted it 
could not get to fit small sound hole  once in sound hole pickup did not work at all  would not buy it 
i ve used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting   this one is the worst   the plastic screw  yes  plastic  that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to  is completely incapable of supporting it s own weight at nearly any angle   bad   just bad secondly  there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp   it seemed loose after i got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement   after twisting on it twice i stripped it out   now the thing is worthless   i m returning it asap i would rather go to a lady s bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing   do yourself a huge favor and buy the nady 6" pop filter   if you don t  you ll wish you did 
its poorly made with attention to detail  i ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at amazon  but they will not screw down all the way and are losse  it is useless    other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine 
just assembly for a try  only few rolls with music  it s had some hole on head  that s mean bad quality  buyer beware for this kind of 
crap these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of ernies i didn t even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right                    never again
this piece of plastic is just terrible   you d be better off with a couple of books and a towel not recommended 
go build your own  build it to your specs and have a solid stand  if not  you can find a lot better head stands  this one was a huge disappointment  does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick  im back with my wood block and am happy 
i might have done something wrong   i read in a review that these hold six picks it held three real well but on the fourth insert the thing just fell apart   i ll just keep using my pockets 
man  this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks  do not buy   it is a wast of money    ug 
i use clayton 1 26mm picks  a heavy pick but certainly not oversized  my picks don t fit    if i shove them in  i can t get them out  also  this thing is huge for the back of the neck 
dont last but a couple weeks  terrible feed back as the ends near the plugs detirorate quickly  will never buy again even if only 5 bucks
second one i bought  lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months  went through two of these before i learned my lesson  don t waste your money on this junk  i love planet waves stuff normally  but these are junk 
i got a couple of these    only buy this cable if there is no chance that it will be ever used in the real world    after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug    and of course   since this cord is molded sealed up tight   it can t be repaired       you could cut off the plug and solder a good 1 4 inch plug on it   but why bother      just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord    this cord is too flimsy      its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug  housing   but inside its junk    thrown away money           buy a lottery scratch off instead   
well this cable certainly didn t last long as the title says 8 weeks   bought a new fender mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago   last night amp would turn on but wasn t putting out any sound from the guitar  messed around a bit and it started to work   today same thing and it s obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp   thought i had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn t very happy   got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either   at least my new amp is working and i only have to replace a $12 cord maybe i m just unlucky and got a bad one and if i bought it at a local store i d return it   not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund   will just move on to another company s cord 
the cable died on me in less than a month  very disappointed in built quality 
i purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists  i was disapointed when i mounted a shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect  these are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics  they may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable  it would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description  i wasted my money  don t waste yours  perhaps viagra would be helpful    
this arrived and when i tried to use it  it turned out that the male threads were some  oddball metric size that does not fit any standard adapter instead  these theads stripped the fitting on my mike clip  so now i have to go somewhere else and buy a new gooseneck and a clip this is such a standard item  that there is no excuse for making it with non standard threads  and no excuse at all for advertising it as standard 5 8ths   
i have several mxr pedals  every one is superb  except for this phase 90  the non "script" version reviewed here   this phase 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean  for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion  a swoosh of sonic dirt  i did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal s distortion suggest some modifications   look up "mxr phase 90 mods " and "erik s corner" will show you how   i made the "r28 " "c11 " and "c12" modifications  the result  a slightly improved phaser  one that still churned out plenty of distortion  finally  i tried adjusting the internal trim pot  on no setting could i get rid of     you guessed it  distortion  i spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable  no luck  bottom line  if you want a phaser that doesn t add significant distortion  avoid this incarnation of the phase 90 
okay   color coding is a great idea divas will not use the red ball windscreen why because  from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose no kidding   i have had several tell this to me and my sound tech   so save your dough  buy any color but red diva s      what can i say 
yes you can tweak it so its less  but cant even use it for recording with or without an amp so much hiss its unusable 
do not use these to polish your guitar  it leaves tons of small fibers all over  and is hard to clean up  a total disaster  these are good for maybe wiping up dog poop  but not cleaning anything 
if you are looking for a 100% leather mandolin strap  consider another strap   the outside surface of the planet waves strap is leather but the inside surface is some kind of man made material glued to the thin leather part   i will be ordering the levys "leather mandolin strap  walnut " 
i bought this to replace a cord i was using to practice my guitar  my first cheap cord wasn t actually broken  but i didn t want any down time  so i had this just sitting there as a replacement  fast forward some time  and i just wanted to try it out  even though my cheap cord was still working fine  i really wanted to just try out the new cord i really wish i had done that in the first 30 days  this cord did not work right at all  it seems like there is a short in it somewhere  i had to unplug plug  maneuver into place  of course since it is for guitar  it falls almost immediately out of place again  so  i am back to the cheap cord that hasn t failed  unlike this brand new bad cable 
the small e string and the g  string both broke on the ball end while tuning   i haven t broke a string while tuning in 20 years  never ever had one break on the ball end luckily i bought the three pack but i can t recommend this product 
i thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings  they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret 
based upon some of the other reviews  i feel i got a different product  as it didn t fit the descriptions given by others  i ordered two of these  and both were very thin material  not sturdy at all  second  both straps were not adjustable to 59&#34   both mine measured 45&#34  from strap button hole to strap button hole  fully extended  they are useless to me  as my guitar  a dreadnought  covers the middle of my chest when i put it on  i believe i was given a substitute product  since when i ordered these straps  the price was just $1 00  and now they re back up to $4 95 as i write this  i m really sick of these amazon substitutions  for what i paid  i won t bother returning them   not worth the hassle  i will donate them to a local music teacher who has students with smaller guitars  very disappointed  warning   if you see a price drop below $4 95  don t buy   it s probably not the product that s described here 
i really wanted this to work  but it doesn t   don t bother it doesn t mute the strings at all   one star  just for it getting here on time 
i bought a glaesel bridge & this glaesel rubber mute together  i bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews  the mute fits the bridge fine  but compared to a brass mute  which of course works very well  this mute seems to do absolutely nothing  there is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on  also  the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises if you want or need a mute for practicing quietly  as many of us do   i suggest you buy something else  this item does not work and is a total waste of money  i tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new electric violin bought here on amazon  fyi  that cheap little electric violin is an awesome & fun item   just make sure you buythe original peg drops by ardsley& aglaesel self adjusting 4 4 violin bridge mediumwith it   i consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all  it does  not  mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way 
pedal is not working  it just making noise  poor quality control actually it looks like used pedal  not like new don t recommend this product 
i purchased this as an extra cv controller for a digitech control 2  when i got it  i tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and yes it does suck the tone right out of the signal  as far as a cv controler  it sucks at that too  why  it squeaks as you move it  after 5 minutes use  right out of the box   behringer is a joke and gives german engineering a bad name  although only  conceived  in germany  it s a direct copy of the yamaha fc9 and so i am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares  i m betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it also  you may say "who cares if it squeaks a little"  well i do when i am controlling volume swells or a  wah  effect at low volume in the studio good luck if you buy it 
pretty disappointed in the color  as the review title indicates  what i received is more of a  black chrome  or dingy stainless color  these are simply not going to work with the mots pickguard i purchased them for  perhaps they would blend in better on a black  black pearl or tort pickguard i ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result  perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is  bad   some are very dull looking  very disappointing  really 
i can t believe these were actually sent to me  the heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened  they come from taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to china  i am sending them back  there is no way i would use these  any screw you get from home depot would work better and look more attractive  i am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost 
this pickguard was used  it not only was missing the protective plastic but it actually was scratched from being on a guitar before 
bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat  doesn t fit perfect  kinda bummed but oh well
need 2 volume knobs and 1 tone  so for the price  and in the past  i have always purchased 2 packs together with no issues  however recently i needed and ordered some and i found out of 4 sets  no consistency in quality    example the lettering is thinner on some than others within the same set and between sets of the same item#  also some had bright white lettering and others did not  but where not vintage lettering either   guess these are too cheap for fender to have qc on will try other brands next time 
unless you guys are receiving something i am not  how can you give this anything more than one star  my backplate is so thin and cut so close to the screws that you can actually see were the route begins on the back of my fender stratocaster  this is inexcusable  all the other fender backplates i have have enough lip to cover the route  but not this mint green one  i simply cannot understand what fender is thinking   i am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost 
these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings  these strings last 2 days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed  the high e and the b string tend to break before they even get tuned to pitch  ernie ball strings are garbage  the only time i will buy these is if it s the only thing available  most people like these because they are endorsed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage  and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than 2 days out of a set of strings  touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set  and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh   you can spend 4$ for a set of ernie ball or d addario every 2 days or you can spend $7 for a set of dr strings and change them once a month  or you can spend 10$ for a set of elixir polywebs and change your strings once every 3 months   it doesn t make sense to use these crappy ernie s unless you are sponsored by eb and have an endless supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars 
it is ok  but it does not compare to the ergo holder which you may find here dunlop ergo pickholder the main problem with this pickholder is that it is very difficult to get your pick out  and it is extremely fragile 
i bought one of each soft  medium and hard wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right  the hard is as soft as the soft  they felt exactly the same in fact  the medium was the hardest out of the bunch packaging error  i have no idea  the fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing  so check with what you get sound wise  the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar  making it sound really dull and muted there is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that i do not think it is idea for strumming the only reason i can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly  you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead 
these picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar  i don t like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups  etc  big disappointment  i m getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem  back to the drawing board i go 
ok  it was cheap  nine bucks at the time   the design looked good and sensible  and it seemed a perfect solution to a real need  i bought it without hesitation  however     once hooked up  i was very surprised how flimsy it is  i have a 13" gooseneck  a light condenser mic and small shock mount on it  at the slightest movement of the mic stand this attachment flaps up and down like crazy and will continue this way for a something like a minute if not stopped by hand  obviously  any small bump into the stand will once again set this off  using it at home  i ve gotten away with not touching the stand while recording by being very careful  but obviously this unit is far from ideal  since then  i ve gotten another sidemount boom from this same brand  and though i haven t really put through its paces yet  this other unit is rock solid and far more adjustable and reliable  and only costs a few bucks more  on stage msa9508 posi lok sidemount boom   for anyone considering this product  i highly recommend bypassing this one and forking out just a few more bucks for the on stage msa9508 posi lok sidemount boom  you will be far far happier cheers 
i m another reviewer who has  upon personal inspection  discovered that the rear leg of the stand is too short to provide staedy support for any beloved guitar  i returned it i ve &#34 first act&#34  brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed 
this arrived with one end of the security strap and metal part   broken  ok   i bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option   it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it obviously it was not the packaging which was more than adequate and there were no broken off pieces in the box of course i could not recommend this product to anyone   most disappointing purchase 
they only fit if you have enough room in your strap button  if not they will just pop right out  i threw mine away 
i even called dunlop to see if these lok strap systems would work for an electric acoustic   the guy at dunlop told me "oh yes  they have been specifically designed to work with electric acoustic"   that is not the case   i purchased multiple units  and it will cost me more to return to amazon than it s worth   but basically i know have hunks of plastic that i could use to make a sculpture because of the bottom pin being the plug in for electric pick up  the thickness causes a problem and this plastic do hickey will not fit if anyone out there has a solution for securing the strap  please reply to this feedback what really frosts me is that i called dunlop and apparently their customer service folks don t know their products well enough to be recommending product   it s called  train your people   
hard to believe this was so bad  i have a planet waves locking guitar strap  which is a dream  and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap  however  it is so thick that it can t really fit on a regular guitar strap pin with a strap  and when i tried to lock it  the two pieces came apart  go with the planet waves lock straps 
i bought this because  hey  a wireless mic for $13  why not  i  might  be able to use this in a public address system  the connections all work  and it makes sounds  but the static is unbearable no matter how much i fiddle with different  the adjustment screw in the receiver    nothing works  the audio is always clipped  don t even think of using this for music 
arrive  in trashed packing  but the worst was that it sounded like a piece of chalk on a blackboard    certainly not professional quality or any quality that i would give it 
our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago   every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body  i had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th anniversary american p bass   not good  my son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend the problem with the design is there s a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that s screwed into the body unscrewing itself   we ve tried applying bar soap  petro jelly  and a spray can based dry lubricant     none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon we are switching to the dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero  unscrewing  force we tried to make the shallers work but just could not   maybe we re all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us 
cheap crappy strap  it s too stiff  not comfortable at all  i regret purchasing this    save your money  go hunt for a coach strap or something similar  they are expensive but worth it 
i ve two of these stands  on one of them  the base part of the tubing has lost its tack weld  if you carefully separate the pie slice shaped black foam from the base of the stand  you ll see that the base of the tubing is welded there  mine lost its weld  so the tubing is not secure to the grey base   they separate   i was left holding the tubing while the grey base fell to the floor update  1 9 12 glen ingles refuses to replace or repair the stand  beware     and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in              wait for it                china  that may explain why it failed  but glen ingles could have offered to replace it  i guess he doesn t want me to buy any more of his products  or refer others to his products  well  that s his policy  that s okay  he s got competition  and i ll be purchasing from them instead 
my problem is that i am used to playing hohner golden melody and special 20 harps   i guess i should have paid attention to the other 1 and 2 star ratings   these harps have no volume   don t waste your money on them   i guess the only thing worth having is the case  but the case has no handles or carry strap 5 25 14   i said the case had no handle  well i take that back   there is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat   i was able to fold that little strap outwards and then zip the two zippers up to it   with one finger i can carry the case with my quality harps inside 
disappointing  was looking for to receiving these but  mostly they are unplayable  leak air badly  easier learning bagpipes than these things save your money and get some harps that actually work decent case though 
crikey  where to begin  firstly  i hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet  secondly  they mismarked one of the packets  so it appeared i had two &#34 d&#34  strings  instead of two &#34 e&#34  strings  lastly  and certainly the least favorably  once tuned up  the strings sounded terrible  they were tinny and clangy sounding  i ve never heard worse strings  fortunately  i had bought a package of ernie ball earthwood med  light  as well  i replaced the godawful martins with the ernie ball s and they were far  far better  shame on martin for such a piss poor product  i ll never buy their strings again 
i am very disappointed  the guitar was packed with its strings tensioned and the top detachment partially from the guitar body it is unusable until repaired update  it has been several days after writing and attach photographs to the seller  amazon   and have not received any communication 
i wanted to like this  i really did  the idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think  &#34 perfect&#34   however  the unit i received was cr@p  and i m going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions  the one i got kept cutting in and out  you might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75% of the notes or something  and when holding a chord  the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds  frustrating i did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit  the so so sound and overall quality however didn t compel me to give it another go  bummer  any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability cheers
it doesn t seem to work  i think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesn t seem to absorb any water 
the sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously isn t going to last long   also  trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing i m going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it 
this thing is useless  good idea  but way too light rickety to be useful  unless you re constantly aware of it  99% of the time you ll end up just kicking it over when you go to put your foot on it  pass on this 
i ve had it for about a month now and it hasn t fallen apart so i guess that s a plus  but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective  as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore useless   thanks to this problem i am only able to use two slots out of twelve   it s definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting  stay away from this 
it s really not a 200w system   the booklet even says it is only 100 watts  and i doubt it is really even that powerful   the wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it   my shure xlr wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug   the instrument input works ok with my taylor guitar  but it s not 100 watts loud   i guess it s ok as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals 
i have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly  i have had enough the main problem with this tuner is the usability the tuner has a poor display  is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key tuning with it can be condensed into one word   frustrating the needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever i pick the strings  especially so when the guitar is much out of tune the poor display is dark  with no build in light  and has poor visibility at angles too  combine all that you have a terrible  accurate tuner yes  it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display  which is +  2 cents enough said  i bought a new tuner  the seiko sat800  for a bit more money that this the main differences between sat800 and the ca 40 sat800 has a build in light  ca 40 does not ca 40 has a build in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle  sat800 does not sat800 has a auto and manual mode  ca 40 has auto sat800 displays the octave of the note  e g  1e  2e  etc  ca 40 displays only displays the alphabet  e for all oactaves sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off  ca 40 does not the needle graph on the seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall i wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner  i was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on amazon and i hope you would not be 
this tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn t really work  as soon as i insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low b flat and stays there    even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end  at first i thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this  i also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine  so again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input 
i ve been very disappointed with this tuner  when i ve used it the needle keeps jumping all the way to the right sharp  then back to the left flat   i have two 2  other tuners i bought from wal mart and i always get accurate tunings from them   i bought this korg because it s a brand name and the company has an outstanding reputation  even though my tow 2  wal mart tuners are older  they both still work better than this korg 
there are better tuners out there  far better  this could be good  but it seems to me that all korg products seem to think of standard tuning as the only tuning out there  and they don t even tune it well to standard  especially when tuning the g string   i personally play exclusively in standard for my electric playing  but sometimes i want to fiddle around with open tunings on an acoustic  this piece of junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using "f" or "c" notes  i have no clue as to why that is  pretty stupid if you ask me  especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d bags  i say that with love  that play in open tunings  trust me  your money is best spent elsewhere 
this would have been a nice slide if i could get it on my finger   i m borderline skinny and it still won t fit   save your money unless your under 10 years old 
lets face it  in general string winders are pretty much all the same right  wrong  i went with this one because i trusted the dunlop name  what a let down  on the second guitar i used it on the handle and the head separated  sure you can press it back together  but after separating several times on every string  it gets a little old    quick  already ordered a different one to replace it  one thing i cant stand is inferior tools 
ok its cheap  you knew that when you bought it  i really thought it was going to be more then one since it said assorted and showed a few in the picture  it was only one and it was red  broke with first use 
this strap is uncomfortable and too flimsy to feel good  also doesn t fit an instrument where there s no place to hook it    i returned mine  as it just didn t fit well for my uke or mandolin 
sorry fender   this one is just a waste of money   get something better that doesn t twist up an ravel into knots 
this pedal  in short  sucks   there s no point to having an a b pedal if it adds a huge amount of hiss to your sound  behringer needs to go back to the drawing board with this 
it s a decent unit  but stopped working completely after about 6 months  tried everything i could  but it s gone  i would not recommend this pedal 
behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light  cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging  i just didn t want to spend $100 on the boss version  but you get what you pay for  another thing that i hate is it s really hard to change the battery  unlike the boss pedals  save your money and steer clear of this one  i also bought a behringer power amp for $200 that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out 
bought this because of all the great reviews  butthis doesn t work  just like the last beringer product i bought  will i ever learn  very disappointing update  now working  got my mate an aussie genius to have a look found pedal wasn t engaging when pushed down took plastic cover off and pressed black button with his pinky and light came on  sheer genius worked fine with cover off  then replaced cover with new bit of rubber  and it still works amazing sound actuallystill not sold on berhinger though
ok i understand it now   i use abelton live 8 and thought this would be and easy  read cheap  interface to record some instruments with  wrong  i am returning it  it does not work  has no drivers and is not detected on my mac  my mac finds everything   bought the focusrite unit instead  got it to work on garage band but latency was miserable and so was hiss on recordings  save your money and time  buy the focusrite interface or one of the others  yes over $100 but you either want feedback  hiss and frustration or you want a smooth interface connection with good resonance  it also lacks 1 4 plug  one rca input  you need an addapter  not what i thought i was getting   dumb me 
not very bright  not very flexible  too big  clunky  i really don t like it  i wish i had went in a different direction 
they say 2 4 months  i ve never come close to even a month  usually 3 weeks and they are toast in a guitar case not opened more than twice in that 3 weeks   if it sounds too good to be true  it usually is   i don t recommend these 
i bought this pedal new  hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage   i knew going in that it would not sound like a martin d 28  but i thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars imagine my profound disappointment really  boss    this is by far the worst pedal i have ever used of yours   this thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the "top" control higher than about 9 o clock   at first i thought i must have a defective unit  but then i started reading reviews on line   seems like it is part of the design  it s too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones  hidden beneath a wall of fizz  totally unusable  as far as i m concerned  by the way  i tested it direct to a pa as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar  strat  
i bought this pedal as a companion to my roland ac 33 acoustic amp   the pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy   however you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate   this is totally unnecessary for a foot switch   the worst part is the leads on the battery connector  9 volt  were not properly soldered or had shorted out   the only way i could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made   for the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed  i e  all that has to work are two switches and a battery  you would think that boss would put out a better product   i also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close  leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question   i would highly recommend that you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site 
sadly  i can t review the mic itself nor the cable that comes with the mic as they were both non responsive   i tried the mic with other cables i have lying around that i know work  and i got nothing  it was like the mic wasn t plugged in at all   and the cable included in this pack  well  the plastic  not metal  connector to the mic was cracked   i still tried it with a difference mic    static i can t blame amazon for the broken bits as the whole thing was packed well and the box did not appear damaged the stand that comes with this set up seems really good for the price of the whole package   i was impressed at how much of is  isn t  plastic still    i can t recommend this product 
doa   no good  out of the box plug it  nothing     no way to send it back  i`m not from the states     meaning   i just wasted away $40 something bucks  add shipping     i did bought a behringer pedal before  tremolo pan  with good results  but i guess there`s two sides to this particular low economy pedals    well  i`ll man up and buy something else   
it sounds very artificial  i remember first getting this pedal and really loving the sound and kick it had  now that i use it with a better amp  it sounds very processed and artificial in sound that it s not even worth the price i payed for it before  i also had bought another one to replace the first one because the input section jack got messed up in the amp that it didn t want to lock with my guitar cable and when i took it apart  there was no way for me to fix it other than sending it to be replaced  shitty pedal 
ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home "12 23 11" and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset  i would not returned because i don t feel like fighting with no body but they shouldn t do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for 
it was not what i wanted  when a person has a low income we can not afford what we can not use  i was looking for what is called shimmer most reverbs do not have shimmer as the rv600 because digitech called shimmer  string swell and volume swell is linked to the violin sound it cost me 30 00 its called slow motion for a reason because it has to be played slow to hear the effect the only way to hear it is with over drive being played on the high strings  it might be good for playing with a bow  i have no idea because i can not afford a bow 
i just got this and i ve noticed that it when i activate the pedal it sucks almost all of the bottom end out of my tone    i have a crybaby that doesn t have the range the 847 does but its 10x s more transparent   there may be other factors at play here as it is new  but the lesson is  try it before you just buy it to make sure it works for you 
garbage if you like it   then buy it this is not how the world of music sounds too much bass and other garbage   are you guys really hearing anything  world has gone bass crazy since about 1981   more and more  we lost analog  we lost quality thanks tocompression and mp3  and now to put morecrap into our ears  they give you onefrequency   bass only   take it or leave it will go find real headphones  thanks kb
if you want to use this to power up a tascam dr series digital recorder  i have a less expensive solution for you   if you own a usb wall charger  like a cell phone charger   you can use that to power your device through its usb port  that s a lot cheaper than spending twenty something dollars on an additional wall wart 
i purchased this after reading many favorable reviews online and it seemed like a good unit for the price  after trying to use it i promptly returned it  i do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows   i have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer   i tried recording on the h2 using it s line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my mackie sound board or my stereo receiver   no matter how i set the levels the recording on the h2 was very distorted   i played with the record levels and the agc and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal   i have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean  good quality sound   the problem with my h2 was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal  which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp  recording from the internal mics seems to work fine   i have worked with professional sound equipment for over 25 years and the zoom recorders are the only brand where i have found this problem the h2 has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings  look for something else   i exchanged this model for an h4n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal  but not as bad as the h2   i finally ended up getting the tascam dr 07 which i am very happy with   it has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder 
the cables are great for the price cant go wrong i have not used them for a long time but so far no problems i ordered 6 more cables don t buy this cables they keep failing  cheap material with what i spent on them you could buy a couple decent ones
be careful  i have a small recording studio  so we put our cables through a lot  and these guys just don t last  they were fine for the first few months  but then they started to die like a murder mystery  seriously  one after another they would just go  for no apparent reason fine one second  and then it would just go horribly staticky  i actually had two blow at one time  and thought my pa was shot  thankfully  it was just these cables  not good  spend a little extra on another brand  these have been my favorite gls audio 25ft cable cords
i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people   the strap is about 6" too short for my seagull s6 guitar   i will say the build quality is great but too short  is and remains  too short   i will keep this item and take it to a shoe shop or saddle repair place and have and extendo put into the strap   i just can t understand how they can sell this a a guitar strap when it is clearly too short 2 22 2013 i fired off an email to levy and the long and "short" of all this is you will have to fork over another $30 to buy an extendo for this strap  i don t quite understand why they don t make the strap long enough to start with other than the fact they can extract another $30 to make it work right in the first place   here s a link to the extendo optionlevy s leathers mmgxl 2 5 brn strap extender http   www amazon com levys leathers mmgxl 2 5 brn strap extender dp b00bh5n91e ref=sr_1_2 ie=utf8&qid =1361565768&sr =8 2&keywords =mmgxl 2 5  the irony here is i managed to buy the last one for the immediate future this is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider  i got the extendo strap and it does not match the original so now i have this cobbled up looking guitar strap  it s sort of like wearing a suede shoe on one foot and a polished leather shoe on the other   i will keep this strap but sure feel like i ve been had on this purchase    the terms bait and switch come to my mind 
i have no idea what happened or if anyone else had this problem  but i got literally 8 plug ins  and not the part where you can plug in an existing cable to make this into a chain  it s like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends  soooo it s pretty much useless to me  i guess if you get one of those power blocks with 9v outlets on them  i guess you could plug this into it but i really see no point  i would ve shipped it back i lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss  i think i payed like $8 for it so whatever  i would recommend going to an actual music store so you can physically see both the male ends and the female end 
i ordered this plug because it is advertised as a &#34 1 spot&#34  brand plug  it is not what i received  instead i received a generic plug  for eight 9v connections that would definitely fit the purpose  but a really cheap version  the plugs on this generic version are larger than the 1 spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic  the original 1 spot plug has much smaller plugs  great for saving space on a pedal board  and the wires are soft and &#34 rubbery&#34   again making it easier to work with on a pedal board  specially if you re working with a pedal board like pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars  i informed the seller about the issue and was told it was a mistake and that they would send me the correct one  in my email to them i included an image of the original packaging of the 1 spot 8 plug to make sure there would be no mistake  but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug  i emailed them again for a refund  which they promptly did  i can say  that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money  i imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original 1 spot plug  wouldn t know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight 9v connectors  i strongly recommend  spend the extra two or three dollars and get the original 1 spot 8 plug 
the cable hisses  crackles and pops right out of the package   save your money and buy a better cable   i will buy cables locally from now on so i can easily return them if they are defective   i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else 
as i ve heard with the pyle pro amps  i received mine today  and it was defective  only one channel worked  and it definitely looked like it took a beating before it arrived at my doorstep  the packaging was very good though  so i m  thinking this looks like a refurb used  and they listed it as new  already printed the return shipping label  and it will head back to the amazon warehouse on monday   
this cover does not fit a full size acoustic electric hohner guitar   i measured the whole at 3 7 8&#34   but this cover does not even come close to fitting   it measures 4 1 6&#34  in diameter  so check your guitar closely 
doesn t reduce sound worth a darn   i thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things   muddies it up a bit maybe  but not really a reduction in db 
these speakers worked great for 14 months  last week  4 8 13   one of them wouldn t power up all the way  the problem is getting worse every time i try to use them  and it s just a matter of time before it stops working   it seems there is a problem with the capacitors that i did read about in a few reviews  i took a chance on the monitors anyway  and it was a huge mistake  i only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week  i contacted m audio s online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops  one on the east coast and one on be west coast  i ve since found many complaints about this same issue all over the internet and on the m audio support site  m audio doesn t stand behind their products  and i ll never purchase anything from them again 
sound nice  but very unreliable bx5a deluxe i own a pair of yamaha ns 10s and event 20 20s  and they are all currently working without problems with over 10 years use 2 years ago i purchased a set of regular bx5a s  and they lasted about 1 1 2 years  and then the faulty capacitors leaked i just replaced them with the bx5a deluxe model  and after only one week  one of the internal amps will no longer power up i need a pair of affordable av shielded monitors that i can depend on  and these cheap m audio monitors are not it i am back to using my 20 20 s with slight av noise until i find a decent av shielded monitor m audio was a much better company before avid took them over 
in an attempt to see what s new in the pick industry  i decided to dive in and give these a go   they are way too flimsy if  like me  you use a heavier pick   i have always used dunlop tortex greens and these davas just can t compete   not only were they too flimsy  but when i played with any aggression  heavy rock based material   the picks would fly out of my hands   this was a huge disappointment 
unhappy with it  actually i already replaced them  the method of attachment is poorly designed  it doesn t matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls  the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions  expensive locks too 
i had some issues with my 18 watt all tube amp so i experimented and replaced all the tubes   issues not only continued but worsened   hum  noise  volume fade  unwanted distortion at low volumes   i eventually put back the original el84s and that didn t help   once i removed the tung sol 12ax7 preamp tubes and replaced  the hum stopped  sound quality of the amp was consistent  quiet and back to par   my experience with the tung sol tubes was very  very negative   they caused me to go out and buy another amp   i had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast   i ll never buy this brand again 
don t buy this chinese piece of crap if you really need a three guitar stand  it is barely workable for two it is easy to set up  but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place  and you absolutely  have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floor ground the best thing these stands are built for are v type guitars such as my jackson rhoads as long as you can put them back to back  for les paul and strat type axes  their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow  stick like feet of the stand  especially when they are new  you can t tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet won t support enough weight to make that possible  so this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand  if you just gotta buy something from on stage  get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it ends up being better balanced  but really  you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hang this is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for 
this is a fantastic product that is well made  the plastic is heavy duty and comes with a plastic cover that must be removed before use  this ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition the tool is extremely useful  i have just started playing with a band  and it is very common for band members to call out a song and the key that it is in  with the wheel  i immediately know what chords to choose from  i also know what notes are in each chord  in addition  it has a note by note image of the entire fretboard so that you can see where the roots are for the scale you are playing the wheel is also invaluable for switching keys  for example  say you re playing the i  iv  and v chords in the key of c   but your lead singer is having trouble and would rather sing it in bb  all you need to do is dial the wheel to bb  find out the new i  iv  and v chords  and start playing  the wheel makes chord transposition a breeze i feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair  this is a very useful product at a fair price no  i am not affiliated with the company at all  i m just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool in my opinion  this is a five star product 
this capo isn t quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar  if i position it just so it will work as long as i don t bump it or a string will pop out of one side 
i bought one of these for a vintage fender showman that doesn t have built in reverb   put a battery in and plugged it in   very simple   but the sound was horrible   no setting delivered an effect that sounded anything like any kind of reverb i ever heard or would want to hear   the closest i could get was a cheesy delay or echo effect that sounded awful   on the other hand  the reverb from my korg ax 100g  that i was using on another rig  was great   maybe my dr600 was not functioning properly  but i don t think so   i think that s the way it really sounds   so i got a return authorization from amazon  very easy   never fails   put it back in the box and ups picked it up the next day and i got a full refund jm tepper
often  we get what we pay for  after researching various pieces of sound equipment for weeks and weeks  i chose solid items for reasonable prices i should ve known better to skimp on what is a critical piece of the puzzle   the quality of the cable  this item simply didn t ever work   it arrived with a bent pen on one end  and even when we attempted to straighten it  it didn t connect well onto the mixer board  the microphone end was a very shaky connection with the most intermittent power conveyed to the mic don t buy this item   spend the relatively small extra amount and get a more reliable brand 
if you re a metalhead  stay away   i tried this on multiple metal pedals and the peavey rogue g10 blows it out of the water  this thing sounds like crap with anything distortion  it s great for jazzy blues and an ultra clean tone though or that classic fender crunch  but if you demand metal  get far away 
i tried with with my macbook pro with both mountain lion and mavericks  also with my win7 x64 machine  i tried it with a variety of midi capable gear including trying to update firmware on fx hardware  sending and receiving midi pc and midi cc  as well as transmitting midi clock in and out  i simply couldn t get this to work most of the time  active sense used on most roland products seems to kill it completely in contrast i purchased the  mu s xmidi 1x1 tab and it works flawlessly and without issue every time i use it i should have totally returned this product  instead it s in a landfill 
doesn t wotk with v amp 3   doubt it works at all   red light always stays on and i ve never seen the green light 
they have no grip at all they brake and ware out in a hour or so of hard playing there just junk for newbie that don`t know any beter but hey what do you expect they are made by d addario get some real picks like dunlop tortex
i have a real problem with these patch cables   i got them as a christmas gift but they don t stay in my pedals  input jacks without causing problems and having to push them in on occasion   most problematic is the connection between my ehx memory boy and digital memory man    never had problems with any other cables here  but these refuse to stay put without having to constantly adjust 
i thought it was my jack for a while  then i noticed it wouldn t stay in any pedal   there is no "click" assuring that the cable is in place    and there s a reason for that  it isn t  slips right out of every pedal i have   not reliable 
bought it after read reviews  i had signal loss using these cables   it s like having a loose connection inside the cable  my connections were on and off  i thought i had a dead pedal   i have to wiggle and hold to get signal  it s too flexible almost like twizzlers  no kidding    if you want a cheap and reliable pedal cables  go get the one from pro co  i bought it very cheap from sweetwater on ebay  surprisingly very good quality and looks durable 
the boss me 70 is not as nice as the boss gt 10 and will not let you install boss gt 10 patches by james limborg   i recommend getting a boss gt 10 and then install boss gt 10 patches by james limborg   now your guitar can sound like eddie van halen  joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound with boss gt 10 patches by james limborg   search google for boss gt 10 patches by james limborg 
as soon as i attached my mic  and with my strong hands  i over twisted the mic holder on the threads  and the thread piece came loose on the stand   i think i can fix it with some liquid metal  but this is not as impressive as some mic stands i ve had in the past   sincerely  docafter a few months of trying to make it work   it doesn t   i changed my rating from 3 to 1  this puppy is just poor quality 
i have three mic stands  with this one being the fourth  i still have three mic stands because this one was absolutely horrible 1  the top mount would rarely stay fixed and kept dipping down 2  the bottom clamp never did secure properly  it kept opening up even without a mic on it  the weight of the stand itself stripped it i sent it back without hesitation 
i used to buy a lot of wire form these guys     however  you need to be careful and test everything you get from them on an xlr cable tester i didn t believe it myself   i read another reviewer had an issue with xlr cables being wired incorrectly from pin to pin  so i took my handy cable tester and went through about a dozen cables i got through only 4 monoprice cables before i found one that was miss wired  now i will be checking all of them for sure not a good start though glad the other reviewer made that discovery and passed it on i suggest everyone check their monorpice cables  the testers are very cheap and may show problems you weren t aware of 
the coversion cable didnt work  t is  axlr to ubs cable  i have the red  blinking light syndrome also  but i learned awhile back dont try to fix something you paid for send it back  so izm thanks hde for wasting my time  go sell your snake oil to someone else         
these types of pedals are toys  they are a cheap way for a beginner to have effects to play with  by all means if you are buying it for your kid who just started playing  if not  i recommend slowly building your pedal collection and use the money to get 1 decent pedal whether it is a delay  or distortion 
i had a friend with one of these and he loves it  i got one on his recommendation and when i put the batteries in it  it started smoking  it did work for awhile  i pulled the batteries out and tried to ac adapter and it smoked again  this time it did not work  i am one of those people who gives an item one try and if it does not work  holds a grudge  i would not advise anybody to get this 
a loud hum will crescendo in every few minutes even if the ground is lifted   works great in intervals though  too bad those intervals are minutes 
it stopped working after 2 gigs  i m not sure why  but it is very frustrating  i guess you get what you pay for here 
our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago   every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body  i had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th anniversary american p bass   not good  my son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend the problem with the design is there s a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that s screwed into the body unscrewing itself   we ve tried applying bar soap  petro jelly  and a spray can based dry lubricant     none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon we are switching to the dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero  unscrewing  force we tried to make the fender shallers work but just could not   maybe we re all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us 
unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage  i tune my hellraiser to d then drop to c and it will not register  the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes 
i was looking for a portable fold up stand that i could take to gigs and searched around   found the guardian at amazon and thought for $10  how could i go wrong   oops  wrong   the stand is sturdy and folds up nicely  but i found it next to impossible to get my fender jazz bass to stand up in it   the lack of an extended support for the neck means you have to try to balance the guitar very precisely against the apex of the stand and pray that no one gets near it or that the wind doesn t blow   this is ok for a lightweight acoustic that you don t care too much about  but for for an electric guitar or bass  no way i just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support   live and learn 
i have an epiphone les paul and this stand does not hold it at all   the holders are too far apart to keep the guitar from sliding through onto the floor   maybe it s a decent stand for an acoustic or a fatter electric   but given that les paul is a pretty popular model of guitar  this should not be sold as an electric guitar stand   i m rating it for what it is sold as  and for that  it gets 1 star  and only because since there is no zero 
this product has almost zero documentation in the box or on the akai pro website   technical support is also almost zero   akai seems to not care about getting new users up to speed on their products   customer service is basically "if you have to ask  you should not buy this"   i asked the akai technical department which sequencer software i needed and they told me to go to a music store   this may sound stupid but unless you have a lot of midi knowledge and experience don t buy this product   try finding a midi tutorial that is usable   good luck with that chore added 08nov2010  the keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing   i sent an email to akai asking for a replacement but they do not have any parts   i find that unbelievable 
the box contained a bag with just the bottom half of the stand  the top section with the mic thread attachment was missing  sent it back and did not reorder 
the material used is fine   the looks are fine   the length is horrible   this is too short for most adults that play guitar   it felt like i was holding my guitar around my neck instead of off my shoulders   i attached it by the longest way possible and it was well short of what i could use   to me this was a worthless purchase   i just tucked it into a drawer and it will sit there and not be used again 
i got a few of these as a christmas gift and they re just bad   i put them on my pedalboard where i previously had longer cables and these just didn t stay in the jack   i have no other problems with these jacks with any other cable but these   if i play loudly and my room vibrates a bit  the cable even works its way out of the jack a little bit and cuts my signal   awful 
so heres the thing that no one else wants to say  the thing is built like a piece of s     it jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around  i used this 3 times and it shorted out  the lights started flashing and it got hot  i called line 6 and they determined it was bad so they opened a "ticket"  fyi if you want to deal with the worst customer service in the industry just call line 6  not only do they not know what they were talking about but in the backgrounc i could hear them lauging and joking like there was a big party going on  i wish i would have never bought this but hopefully i get  a new one soon  well see how helpful they really are 
i have always loved line 6  this product sounded great for about an hour then total gave up  it went dead  i changed channels and it worked for like a minute then went dead  i am sorry to say that i returned it  my akg wireless guitar bug has lasted years with no drop outs i am really disappointed 
i was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived  just to find out it wasn t working    it is defective  and because i brought it to mexico  now i can t get a refund or a replacement i will try to fix it through some local electrician or something  very dissapointing 
one of the ball bearings designed to catch and lock the side mounted to the strap dislodged  and my very expensive fender custom shop telecaster fell flat on the ground 
sounded good  warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac15  i rocked all night and loved the sound  next day i turned it on  my amp was crackling out and wiping out the signal i checked the tubes and one of them was making violent purple flashes before the signal burnt out  i then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well  i changed out the fuse and checked again and the tube was still doing the same thing so i just swapped the tubes back for atock  id like to see a real set of jjs  im sure one of them was a dud 
i play harp with some some that i perform  i found that all of these harmonica s the note s are off and it s hard to play  i have g blues harp that i compared the g harp to and the notes were a little off  the c harp was terrible  that said the only thing i like about this order is the case  i going to see if i can return them for store credit 
too thick  no flexibility  sounds really harsh and like it is ruining my ukulele strings  tried on bass too  again with less than satisactory results 
at the time i bought  was $16   mine arrived broken  so it had gone back   reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken   not upset about that   stuff happens   it is just not a good stand   light construcion  unstable  topples easily  and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped   the  protective  materails on the stand to keep product from scratching your instrument are the soft  shiny runner like materail and it  sticks  to my instrument s neck   so i pick up uke and i get a stand until the stickiness is seprated by gravity   happened every time   yes  i tried out the stand even though broken  and it proved to be a bad choice   back it has gone   5 stars to amazon s return policy  thouh 
there is a problem with the design   when you move the head  the 3 little plastic pieces that hold the ball that allows you to rotate the head  just break off   the tuner itself is great  but the product fails because it broke in 5 minutes 
for some reason  this one just doesn t hit the notes right   it looks like it should tune more precise than other models but the tone is way off for mine anyway   i have tried it several times and it just doesn t tune right   then i recheck with my other brand and it s not even close   maybe i just got a bad one   i like that this one shuts off automatically  but again  it s way off tune i did like the style  size and color     but it doesn t work right so it s like running with a flat tire   
i ordered this from the amazon warehouse as a refurbished item  it was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together  the glue didn t  hold so the clamping base separated from the stem that allows the meter to swivel  this was unfixable so i sent it back for a refund  warehouse deals are not such good deals 
very accurate tuner but it broke within the first week i used it   the little head on the tuner is connected with an arm and a ball and even when  you are gently the three prongs holding the ball joint can crack and break rendering it useless   i will try to get a replacement    now as a tuner it was really quite good but just not durable which is kinda what you need 
like the other one star reviewers    my problem is that the head broke off  i tried to glue it back on  but it just fell apart even worse when i tried to do that  if you buy this  you really need to baby it  my advice is look for a more sturdy model 
   what is the sound in the background of the hissssssssssssss  my guitar i guess  but who cares  i honestly bought this gizmo for the extremely good hisssssssssssssing nothing else a question to amazon  companies producing objects that are nothing else than a lemon shouldn t be prosecuted p s i think it is "too polluting" for  low cost  items to waste again in paper box  transportation  restocking work  refund work and so on  this is why 99% of the time i do not ask for my money back   but   sell this lemon on amazon  online with other websites   and in all the instrument shops worldwide in a total bad faith  while testing nobody in irig noticed the overwhelming  hisssssssing   well that is beyond me 
my review s  for this have changed a few times  but no more  when i first got it i liked the sound  though it did sound a little cold and digital  and this is from someone wanting to record shoegaze dreampop  which by it s nature is full of cold tones  reverb chorus delay  shimmering  a la cocteau twins  chapterhouse  lush  so at first i thought it was great  then the fuse software was even cooler  all this customizing the sound  though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise away after all of that i finally realized i was trying to ignore the fizz crackle hair  it s called a few things  go to the fender forums and look it up  or search it on yahoo google the thing happening with this amp i think is a few things  fender guitars sound best through it  which is silly if you don t own a fender  and i don t and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out  i wanted anything but a strat body  unless i have a grand to pay for an older one  i m not going to get a rinky dink one  and i would only get one after i got like 5 other dream guitars first so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality  also  playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer  that may be fine for some  younger folks   but to a lot of people i ve read the complaints i was trying not to realize  as i didn t feel like having to pay for shipping to return it  but i did and i am so glad i did  i almost got a peavey vypyr  and i am glad i didn t  this amp  to be fair  is really close to being really cool  but that sound problem  which i read on fender s own forum website  fender acknowledges it exists  but does nothing to fix it in future models   sorry  but that s some big company b s i ve been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that  and i was like "what music snobs" and what have you  but i realized that i m a music snob  i love the music i listen to more than anything  and feel like the music i create should have a life to it as well  so i returned the mustang 2 and almost got a marshall mg 30 watt  cause i wanted an amp with a clean sound that didn t have that crackle sound  but thankfully i caught myself before that return  as after that  it would have been final the decision i did make i think will be great for me  as i d rather start with a good real tone  then get the effects i need  i kept reading reviews of these teenagers that hadn t played for more than a year or two or so saying "throw away your pedals  you won t need them" and "i was going to get pedals  but don t need to now"  that s kind of the danger of these amps  they end up making everyone sound the same  no matter what tweaking i was doing on the mustang  it sounded the same but in a different costume i think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and i ve seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years  maybe that s for them  but i needed something to record with and practice and get the best  most real tone possible  so that means tube amp i think if i played this at a gc i wouldn t of gotten it  and i just tried to make myself like it 
works as advertised but the keys are stiff  pads take too much presure to activate  nice that i dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop after the first few uses the usb socket broke and fell off into the unit rendering it useless  wrote to dealer that was listed as selling it to me thru amazon only to have them tell me the wrong seller was listed  i had registered it with akai already so i complained to them and they sent me a new one  i had to pay shipping back the old one to them even though it was a defective product not recommending this product 
this unit might be great if you have child hands   the keys on the  keyboard is soooo small    don t get this if you have man hands  wtf u date the description akai wtf
a dull  inept version of a tubescreamer  just sounds flat and boring  not very inspiring  at all   then again  i never did really like ts s        
really wanted to like this one  because i loved the price  there is no way this is true bypass  the one i got was defective out of the box  and so when i checked  i saw the circuitry did not support pass through   maybe it is because i received a defective one  but i still wouldn t try this brand name  i am now stuck saving up for a full tone or something 
i honestly don t see the purpose   it doesn t seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar   i ve used it a few times  but don t see the benefit edit 5 30 13 after coming back to read the other reviews  it s obvious what happened   this was shipped to me completely dry   there was no grease lubricant qualities   it was like a dry erase pad   they need to improve their quality control   i m changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star   they have to find a way to fully secure this gap or maybe consider enhanced vacuum sealing packaging i would suggest if you receive this product and it hasn t dried out yet  to place this product in a air tight ziplock bag to reduce the likelihood of this drying out 
the cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes  i don"t like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time i used it  the cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and i lost sound  this cable is complete garbage  never again 
i purchased this amp locally and initially  i thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp  lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds  this was my first fender amp as well the presets were neat and all  but when i played around with some of the "standard" models  just the amp model  no effects  just to see how it s clean sound was  the amp just hissed as if i had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max  the master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on    i ve never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it  even when there was no guitar plugged in    all i could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes  very distracting and it drove me nuts  this isn t a ground loop issue  my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond   it s clearly a defect with this product  dirty pre sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse  again  even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume  you d think i was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil  but nothing was plugged in and all i get is staticy hiss at low levels  wtf the next issue is the weird "fizz" sound  that was especially noticeable on the low e  after striking a string  instead of a clean note  there s a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that "surrounds" the note  and fades as the string stops moving  it almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored mp3 file at a low bit rate and frequency  whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable the weird thing is  neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in  or when this was connected to my computed via either usb or the line in    but i m not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my pc or cans  i got the iii instead of the ii because of the power behind it and the touted 12" celestion speaker read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar amp related websites  there s a 65 page forum post on the fender support site that is quite interesting  and you ll find that these amps are having issues  apparently  the mustang i and ii don t have these issues  and the firmware update did nothing to correct my amp  is this a hardware issue  software issue  speaker issue  there is speculation that the lcd screen  which is not present on the i or ii  may be causing problems  but no one seems to know for sure and fender doesn t seem to care   definitely try this before you buy it  you may get an amp that doesn t have these problems  you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care  let your ears tell you what sounds good this amp has a lot of potential for great sounds  and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps  but in my opinion  technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage  i am disappointed that fender hasn t yet correct what ever is wrong  some folks claim that fender reps say that know what is wrong  but i m not taking that as a fact      but they have acknowledged that there is "something" wrong whatever    i took this back after a few days of playing with it  trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success  the built in noise gate helps a little  but sucks tone  and i picked up a 100 watt marshall instead  guess what  the clean channel has zero hum or buzz  even when cranked  how about that  even when i engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels  there is minimal noise i ll knock fender for not correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it  but they do have some other nice amps that i d like to try  but before i buy another fender amp  i ll take it for a test drive and i suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds 
a great idea  but pure crap in terms of functionality   if you don t have something heavy on the flat end  the rubber piece moves  and before you know it  your axe is on the ground   i saw some pictures of putting a 12 ounce can on the flat part as a counterweight  but i m not so hot with that idea  especially if the can is open   the lip need to extend down longer  and  something  needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around   if i had a permanent place to mount this  i d gorilla glue it down  but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and i ll get an extra guitar stand instead   good idea  but it doesn t work 
allotoday went to the stores to test out the followingtascams   dr 05   dr 07 mk2  and dr 40  and  for myself ended up buying nothing   their differences for your  ears   are    dr 05   this is a good quality toy   no line in   use its own mic  you will be ok  with this  for meetings  etc not really that good for  music   can be done  but not as good  if you use ext mic   u wont be happy either   high background hiss noise  relative to all 3 dr 07etc etc   only slightly better than 05   all else same   dr 40 was much quieter in noise level   be it   in mic  ext mic or line inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars   this can be used to   semi   record music too so  testing on their own mics   that last one was far far better than the first two   for those wantingline in   means only that dr 40   however my tests involved  checking  sound quality  of bit more seriouslive recordings   took output from our  zoom r 24 recorder  and  input that to the dr 40   upon comparing the resulting  cds   a   mstr ed by the zoom r24 and print to cd   vs   b   recorded dr40 and printed to cd   the sound was obviously better  with  a  no need to buy  any  a d recorder attempt at this price level  if one is looking for semi serious  master recorder   my budget must be tripled at least   and then to go out to test some more  no cheap way  is there    for those curious  the whole idea has come from wanting to connect  2 units of zoom r24   not wanting to use computer software   taking the 4 outputs from these two into a clean mixer or analog sum box   and getting them downto  2 channels  and finallly to some mastering digital recorder    hoping perhaps the tascam ss r100 or r200 might do the trick in the tests to come    many thanks  and may your camels always have two humps  k
right out of the box  the low e string had a buzz and the intonation was way off  fretted e note on the 12th fret too sharp   after the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved  next  i proceeded to adjust the intonation  i was able to get the intonation for the a  d  g  b  and high e strings spot on  however  after bringing the saddle for the low e string as far back as it would go  the fretted e note on the 12th fret was still sharp i also noticed that the bridge is slightly crooked  the low e string end of the bridge is closer to the neck than the high e string end of the bridge    the bridge could have started out crooked or it could have shifted due to the high low e string tension  loose bridge     which would definitely contribute to the defective low e string intonation i love the red burst design of this guitar  it looks absolutely wicked   unfortunately  i m going to have to return it  i m going to get a squier strat instead  with either amapleorrosewoodneck      update november 15  2013 i ordered the squier strat direct from amazon 6 weeks ago  but it was placed on backorder  i contacted customer service a week ago and was told me they wouldn t get it back in stock until december  then  to my surprise  the squier strat was delivered yesterday  yay    d the happiness  i was able to get the squier perfectly intonated  it s red burst like the legacy  fender calls it antique burst   it s a beautful guitar and and i m loving it 
just use a smartphone to record stuff  this is a really weird  not very intuitive little device that has been antiquated by the iphone and other smart phones  not really worth the $75   i returned mine 
well    it s not really too expensive  but it give you basically the same sound no matter how you set it   even the crunch button is just a louder sound   not a very good value unless you try it out first and this is exactly the sound you re looking for   guess that s why it s so cheap 
this product is bad quality because the noise it makes  it increases the volume so much that it is better not to use it at all  i m going to sell this product  i didn t like it 
downgrade to 1 o star after returning it back to brookmays  the seller i am really disappointed by the seller  brookmays   ignorant responses to my return of the defective cherbub guitar pickup  which picks up unwanted noise by the wire s own movements and the high frequency of feedback that other pickup won t have the same issue   after two weeks of the returned item was delivered  i didn t hear anything from the seller regarding the return  so i emailed to the seller to see if we can settle it asap   too bad  four days after the email had been sent  i only got the email of telling me the case# of the message i sent without any further response to my refund   until my patience is gone to deal with this hassle  and i don t think it s worth to waste more time on it  despite the fact of wasting the time and money i spent on this useless pickup and the shipping costs  therefore  yesterday  i emailed my last contact to the seller regarding the refund of the purchase and gonna report this to amazon about the bad after sale service i ever have before if i still haven t heard from the seller shorty today  i finally received the seller s response to my refund  the seller denies the issues of the pickup and claims  "it was not defective  all pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar  the feedback can be to to many other issues  i have issued the refund of $7 04 "  obviously  the reply is unconvincing  although the feedback can be raised from varies issues  i have tried with another pickup to the same directions and setups  but it doesn t have such problems at all   the fact is not all pickups get unwanted noise although i didn t try many pickups   cherub guitar pickup doesn t work as the product description to pickup the original tones of the instrument regardless the surrounding noises   moreover  the unwanted loud noise from its wire movements is really annoying  and there s no way to stop the wire movements while strumming  indeed  i won t use it  and i don t want it to sit at my house as a useless property  so returning back to the seller may help to improve the issues it has   however  the hassles i got from the seller is totally unexpected and it s not worth at all by the way  i m also unhappy about the refund of &7 04  i bought it for $8 79 along with amazon free shipping of the purchase of $25 or more   to me  it is not the money of $1 75  but it s not fair to the buyer  who doesn t get the right service and quality from the purchase but only wastes the times and money on this matter  so if you really need a pickup for your instrument  i highly recommend you to spend few more dollars to get a much better and reliable one  don t make the same mistake as i did to try this one because of the cheap price  in turn  you may get more hassles than you expect on such cheap merchandise   i don t want that happens to anyone else  so i decided to tell you what i went through to keep you from the possible hassles before betting on it 2 stars for the 1st review after using it twice i like the clip on design  which is easy to use  so it is worth 2 stars  however  it doesn t work well clipping on small soundholed string instruments like ukes and kid size guitars because it touches the strings   besides that  it also picks up loudly through the wire s own movements  not as the description "regardless the surrounding noises "  i have distressed from those unwanted loud noises   one more thing that it somehow produces much higher feedback to the mini amp that i use  and i have to turn the volume as low as possible to prevent the high frequency of feedback  however  when i switch to another pickup with the same setup on mini amp and acoustic guitars or uke  the amp doesn t have any feedback even turning it to almost the highest volume  and the other pickup doesn t have the unwanted noise from its own movement either   i don t know whether is my lack of luck or the poor pickup i got     i bought it because its cheap price  less than $9  & clip on design  but  i can t accept the noises and i have to waste my shipping cost to return it back to the seller  so  if you want to give it a try  you may bear in mind that the seller  brookmays  doesn t take any responsibility for the shipments even the item doesn t work properly as claimed description  good luck then 
i am a long time musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments     wanted to like this     but    first the positives   looks great  nice  easy to read display  the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs  the clip seems sturdy  tuner is compact  nice pricenow the significant disappointment   inaccuratethe settings were on a 440 but every time i tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing  the tuning was sharp     i tested this not only by ear but against other tuners     very disappointing     i have used the old planet waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price  however  since d addario now owns planet waves products  they have discontinued the tuner i like and only offer the ns mini tuner  it has its place i guess  but i much prefer the larger one     too bad they made this decision imo     i haven t settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now i will keep using my old planet waves models    bottom line  no matter how nice the snark is in many ways  the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately  not only string to string but to a standard a 440     having failed that requirement  it is useless for me  especially in a band situation    
i own the sn 8  which btw  is the best tuner i ve ever used  i bought this bc it said it was made specifically for bass frequencies & violin  so i wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin  i was also intrigued by the &#34 tighter&#34  tuning aspect of the bars on this  let me tell you  if it worked  the bars may have been a cool feature  but when you are fine tuning an a string and it tells you you are on e  when you know you are on a bc the other tuners all say a  and it matches the piano   then there is a problem  i could not find any way to re calibrate the thing  so it looks like it s just defective  the one i received was completely useless i am amazed at the great sn 8   i am disappointed in this thing  i must have just received a dud  i hope  since these usually get good reviews   but i will be returning this since it absolutely does not work correctly  on the flip side  i will be getting another sn 8 in it s place  since i know those are great tuners & i love the one i already have 
can t believe they are still selling these things at full price with the old 30 pin connector   i have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector   this is now a boat anchor   to buy a 3 meter cable from them  they charge $40 for the cable  $15 to ship it and then tax   the extortion here is almost monster cable like   these folks should be embarassed 
what was thought to be a doa model  ended up being a mistake on my behalf  my iphone 4s  which i have had for about a year now  must ve had enough damage and wear to the dock connector so that it works fine   unless trying to use the jam in the box  comes with a simple instruction manual that has about three steps it comes with the jam and two cables  usb and ios   it is bigger than i had imaginedit s almost the length of an iphone  feels nice  and is very light  the cords aren t very long 
the velcro itself is insanely amazing  its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing  if you have an alternative means to adhere this velcro to its surface with a strength stronger than 10 men  then by all means  use this stuff  in the end  you just can t make velcro this strong for use with a pedal board  once together  it raises the height of the pedal very uncomfortably  i cannot think of a practical application for this velcro 
the hde xlr to usb is ubs  i have the same problem the red blinking syndrome  i learneda long time ago dont try to fixsomething you paid for send it back  so i did thanks hde for wasting my time  go sell your snake oil to someone else     i
i sometimes see reviews as redundant and unnecessary and i see a lot of positive reviews for this guitar strap  but i don t know why  maybe other people don t really care what kind of strap they have or maybe they just have never had a good strap before  it wasn t too hard to get on and only took a couple of seconds  but once i got it on it was stiff and felt odd  it was very uncomfortable around my neck and i took it off my guitar in a matter of matters  i would honestly recommend spending a few extra dollars on a more expensive and more comfortable strap  unless you re just going for something that is inexpensive  does the job  and isn t designed for comfort 
i ordered 1 just to try it since it was so cheap  the first one arrived in non working condition  wires inside werent even soldered  so i ordered a replacement  plugged it in and it didnt work either  the second wasnt soldered either i know its cheap  but i expected it to at least work  do not buy
it was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china   any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell   if you can wait a month for delivery or longer  if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up   if you have over a $500 guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too  i have decided to build my own
the device itself is difficult to read in bright light my first one arrived not working at all the second one arrived with a low battery  what  after three days the battery goes out i would have returned it  but lost it because it doesn t adhere to the headstock very well  you ve been warned 
50+ years playingmy pedal is unuseablethe lower strings are all mush at any gain or eq settingread all the good reviews and watched all the videosmine sounds nothing like themmaybe defectivei also own the joyo british and joyo crunch and they are flawless
wow  the capture quality of the internal mics is so bad it almost makes me cry  but plug in some real mics and voila  the dr 40 becomes something special     but  i do not always want to carry around so much equpment  and was hoping for better internal mics honestly  my super cheap olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing and why is the line out so darn noisy   must be defective  oh well    gonna  have to send this back 
updated 3 16 2014after owning the 2i2 for over a year and encountering many difficulties i am revising my once gleaming review the 2i2 is a simple set up  pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs  connect a mic or  apparently  a "low headroom" instrument to it  run the usb cable to your computer and set it up within the daw described parameters  it would have been nice to know that the included plug in suite is not a stand alone program  and that it functions in tandem with ableton live lite and that it could be found it in the plug ins section of ableton  but i figured it out eventually regardless   ableton itself is rather dodgy  and seems to crash constantly   sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely  so as no audio is being produced from my monitors i wasn t sure for a very long time if this was user error  an ableton problem  or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers  so after the gazillionth crash  i screamed "ballsdogit   "  and purchased a license for reaper  after going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new daw over the last few months  i began to realize that my monitors no longer "lock up"  but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic   i had to tweak the living daylights out of reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors  now i m in there and the fx do not work with the focusrite drivers  garbage focusrite  everyone i know that has reaper raves about the plug ins  and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface  i have yet to experience a crash  but i also have yet to experience any recording time seriously  i started reading on the reaper forums about problems encountered with the 2i2  and came across a response from david@focusrite actually saying that "you should not use this setup to record electric guitar  "  and that if you need to record electric guitar you should "get something with more headroom like the 2i4 " that is just unbelievable in my eyes i m sure i could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop  but why should i have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle  besides that  i ll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers this device is clearly marked for both xlr inputs and 1 4 instrument ins  there was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation  and i researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit  i feel lied to and disrespected as a customer  now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology  how in the heck does this thing have a nearly 5 star rating       the good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm  i have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2  when not crashing or locking up the monitors  seems to handle all of them well  i constantly check for driver updates  and have the latest drivers for the 2i2  but without a doubt the focusrite scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products sorry focusrite  you dropped the ball here 
hi folks  ok  this thing is cheap  that s cool  but a cheap item you can t use is money thrown away  before buying this i had read various reviews of some folks liking it and others saying it s too small  well  i want to clear this up once and for all  it is too small  specifically  it is too short to reach across all six strings if you go past the third fret or so  depending on your guitar   and it doesn t open wide enough to be able be slid down past the third fret  even on a skinny neck  this thing really is a puzzler  i mean  who the hell would make capos this size  especially when they could ve made capos that actually fit for the same production price and sold them at the same price  someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid  however  a positive from this whole mess is that i finally found a capo to use with my ukulele  and for way cheap  ha ha  but if you are looking for a capo for a guitar of any size  this is utter garbage  cheers 
i have had 2 of these tuners  you d think i d learn after one    they calibrate okay   it s just that they tend to break where the swivel ball fits into the socket of the device  both of mine broke this way    to me  for the price  it s made cheaply   try d addario instead  love their tuners 
the adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap  a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately   replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand   they are light weight and if all you need is mic support in a fixed setting  good enuf okay i guess   but after transporting and reset  i found them to be junk 
kripes man  the one time i go and actually buy a "honer" and its a "bummer" this thing has 3 keys off tune   i can buy stuff 10 times better quality from chinaand never have this kinda junk  maybe it s a fluke because everyone else gave it a thumbs up and i  m really not the type a guy to go running stuff down butmaaan ive never got a harp this trashy b4        all i can say is buy merana s for tryin out buy "suzuki" or swan" from ebay overseas if yer a poor guy like meand you ll be better off  oh btw hot tip for poor guys again    you can get a "mississipi river harp" for only  $5 oo if you have a "burke s" outlet near you they re up by the counter and as good as the high dollar one made by unowho     the doctah has spoken    
this product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside   upon receiving mine and assembling it  it broke immediately while i was trying to mount an ipad onto it   it also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability   the metal parts of it seemed sturdy enough but the plastic parts looked and felt brittle 
this review is on the seller yorozuya yokoshima  not the product  these people posted what seemed like a good price  not ridiculously low  on the us dream pedal  it was to be shipped from japan  they then decided the price was an error and canelled my order  this kind of crap makes me wanna stop shopping on amazon com because the item was less than $4 00 under the next best posted price and these 3rd party sellers yorozuya yokoshima were afraid they wouldn t make a killing on the item  i am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior  i lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident 
let me just start out by saying that i ve been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time  i still own most of these units except for this one   the joyo compressor  my setup is a very simple one   starting with a stratocaster to compressor  wah wah   super overdrive  boost pedal  delay  then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb & vibrato  i don t want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals i ve tried over the years but i know why you want one and how to use them  this thing simply didn t work right out of the box  while the outside of this stomp box is all metal  the inside is full of very low grade parts from china  loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board  i ended up sending it back for a full refund  i don t in anyway blame the seller  they took care of me without a hitch and i would buy from them again   just nothing with the name joyo on it  if you re only buying these based on price i would say buyer beware   you get what you pay for 
it seems to do nothing as an effect and draws power reducing the volume on your instrument as well as the amp   not sure if it is just a broken pedal or if it is just junk  when received the package did not appear to be damaged  but i have tried it on 3 different amps and i get the same results regardless of the amp or the instrument 
update  received 6 of these  5 are ok but one has a bad weld joint at the top retainer  it was held by only one small tac weld i got what i paid for  cheap price and cheap product  no excuse to make this kind of low quality guitar stand  putting a $500 guitar on this is asking for guitar damage when the stand falls apart  not worth the time & $ to send it back to amazon  one star only for this product  good chance that you will get a crappy one if you order this  less than one star for this piece of       
this is a cheap stand and i was not surprised to see it had broke less than 2 day after it had arrived  the top cup that holds the neck of your guitar was welded in one spot only and it was very thin metal where the weld was made  i do not recommend this product 
if you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static  non oscillating  chorus like effect  it s fine for that   as an actual pitch shifter though  this thing is awful   all the pitch shift settings sound like they re 30 cents sharp  this is especially awful sounding when used as an octave effect   i suppose i could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but i did not want to void the warranty so i just returned it   it s hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is   i ve read the same complaint about their pure octave pedal also  this is really too bad because all the other pedals for mooer seem to be quite good   i own their reecho delay pedal and quite like it and i m also tempted to get their green mile pedal if you re not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies  this pedal maybe fine for you but i doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory one minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals   it does not stick to the adhesive on any of the velcro strips i ve tried to use 
i got one of these from another source but have returned it for exchange because of the following issue   when i record a track either with the "audio recorder" or "guitar amp" screens in garageband on my ipad 3  ios7  the recording is great  but once i toggle over to the multitrack view and attempt to play the recording just made  there is godawful distortion and the audio is completely unlistenable   here s the other part of this  i can use apogee jam guitar interface  and irig pre microphone interface and garageband behaves as it should and i can play the multitrack view with no problems whatsoever  the focusrite support folks suggested i do a backup of my ipad contents and then do a software restore but i opted to return the unit instead  since the apogee and irig both work perfectly with garageband  so  i don t know if the unit is having a problem with ios7 or i just happened to get a lemon but i ll find out when the new one comes next week   if it works correctly  i ll update this review after doing a few recordings  but  i would say if you ve just updated to ios7 or are thinking about it and you want to get this unit  you might want to hold off on that upgrade   update  got a replacement unit and even did a restore on my ipad  as suggested by a focusrite support tech  and still have the problem i discussed above   so  this product simply has turned out to be a dud for me  if anyone else has a similar issue with this and find a resolution   please let me know 
i have been using this gig bag for the past few months  if i do the math  i probably didn t use it more than 10 times  basically from home to the subway  from the subway to the studio and back  so maybe 20 minutes walk each time  so i used it for about 3 hrs and 20 minutes  mostly carrying it on my shoulders  sometimes by one of the two handles then the side handle started coming apart  the seam ripped on the side and the handle will eventually fall off if used  it will be ok for a while until the shoulder straps start breaking  which i kind of expect at this point    meanwhile i m going to buy another  sturdier  gig bag save your money and get something better than this 
this thing is crap right out of the box it had holes in the stitching and all the pockets were sown on crooked  what can you expect for $20 tho  this was a temporary solution i don t recommend this for long term use it will probably fall apart 
manufacturer s website claimed that this case would fit a les paul style guitar  i have an esp eclipse  not even close  chromacast products are great  they need to fix the info on their web page  i m not a fan of shaped les paul cases  too bad 
returned this item because the zipper was already broken when i received it  not durable  spend a few more dollars  it is worth it 
a great little package for the price  but unfortunately  the zipper failed the first time i tried zipping it up  i have a standard size acoustic guitar  but be aware  the fit was snug  but not tight 
straight out of the box this product reeked cheap  no directions inside or on the box  i messed with it for about 5 minutes  i would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic  i read the description but it did not say cheap  live and learn 
amazon and tc electronics will not tell you that you need a 9v power supply  i didn t see any warning or advise in the point of purchase  nor in the package  this is an unfair practice from amazon and tc electronics 
let me start by saying that this is a really cool pedal  and tons of fun  i can see how this could make you a better player and i think it could also be used live but  and this is a big but  this is my first "one star" review ever   my first "less than 5 star review" ever   same as others  switch failed less than ten days of owning it  used less than ten times total  light use at home  i wasn t even wearing shoes  by the way  a gigging recording musician for over 25 years so i am not a youngster that misuses my stuff  bummer too great idea    poorly executed i will not buy anther one  i will not recommend to other musicians 
i purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my roland gr55  which has a flawless basic looper built in  but only 20 seconds record and no undo   i had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that i wouldn t need to carry a power adapter along the factory battery lasted about 1 hour  the second brand new fresh duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes  i started recording a loop with another  3rd  fresh battery  tested 9 10 v with a multimeter  and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording  suggesting that it was faulty  the lights started coming on and off randomly  record undo all three together  then off  then undo on  then all three on etc  etc  the first time i used the jamman xt  with the factory battery  it seemed to be working ok and all i can say is that as a basic looper it sucked i am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything  so i know it was not my poor technique  the main problem was that it didn t matter how hard i tried  even if i did a manual fade out  there was always a gap of about 2 seconds between the end of the loop and the start  this makes the unit useless also  it is poorly conceived in that  to replace the battery you have to take out 2 screws    exposing the delicate printed circuit board the potential for damage here is very high  also  replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board  to save a few dollars digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible  read inevitable  damage i have owned quite a few digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this one it s going back to the store where i purchased it 
i really wanted to like these  but they re a frickin  lint catching sticky frickin  mess  they went from my wife s snare back into the holder in a new york minute  have never seen the light of day  and may have been thrown in the garbage  save your money  we use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now
