not much to write about here  but it does exactly what it s supposed to  filters out the pop sounds  now my recordings are much more crisp  it is one of the lowest prices pop filters on amazon so might as well buy it  they honestly work the same despite their pricing 
the product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable i did not realized it was double screened until it arrived  so it was even better than i had expected as an added bonus  one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy i used to buy  so for reminiscent s sake  i cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording   dif you needed a pop filter  this will work just as well as the expensive ones  and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did buy this product    
the primary job of this device is to block the breath that would otherwise produce a popping sound  while allowing your voice to pass through with no noticeable reduction of volume or high frequencies  the double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration  the metal clamp mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached  the goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it 
nice windscreen protects my mxl mic and prevents pops  only thing is that the gooseneck is only marginally able to hold the screen in position and requires careful positioning of the clamp to avoid sagging 
this pop filter is great  it looks and performs like a studio filter  if you re recording vocals this will eliminate the pops that gets recorded when you sing 
so good that i bought another one   love the heavy cord and gold connectors   bass sounds great   i just learned last night how to coil them up   i guess i should read instructions more carefully   but no harm done  still works great 
i have used monster cables for years  and with good reason  the lifetime warranty is worth the price alone  simple fact  cables break  but getting to replace them at no cost is where it s at 
perfect for my epiphone sheraton ii   monster cables are well constructed   i have several and never had any problems with any of them over the years   got this one because i wanted the 90 degree plug 
monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either  this isnt their top of the line series but it works great with my bass guitar rig and has for some time  you cant go wrong with monster cables 
monster makes a wide array of cables  including some that are very high end  i initially purchased a pair ofmonster rock instrument cable   21 feet   angled to straight 1 4 inch plugto use with my keyboards  but when it came time to purchase cables for my bass and guitar i thought i d pinch a few pennies   i am so glad i did i compared this cable model to the more expensive models i previously purchased and  aside from looks  could not detect any difference in sound  i swapped back and forth between my guitars and keyboards  ensuring that each model was used on each instrument   still no difference what the more expensive model has going for it is looks  i am not sure it  the higher priced model  is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier sibling bottom line  carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp   if possible   before making a purchase decision  you may find  as i did  that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value  even from the same manufacturer 
i love it  i used this for my yamaha ypt 230 and it works great  i would recommend it to anyone
i bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard  it does just what i wanted it to do 
wanted it just on looks alone   it is a nice looking cord    i know it will perform   as for sam ash    this cord was packed in a mailer inside another box with my roc n soc    his shipping team do great work  never any complaints from me    i love sam ash   thanks amazon
i ve been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well   for years i used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend   when they finally gave out  i got in the habit of using the no name cables that are always on display near the register at guitar center  really more of an impulse buy than something i put any thought into   after the third or fourth guitar center cable failed from light use i decided to try these cables   not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better   i am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as i move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid cable   i don t mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable   this cable is actually cheaper  $12 or so shipped  and it s holding up pretty well   these are actually very reasonably priced for 18  cables   there is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but i haven t needed it   five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped incidentally  these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp s input   do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab   you want to use unshielded cables for that purpose edit   more than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues   the price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended  there are probably better values from hosa  monster or planet waves 
fender cords look great and work just as well  by adding the word california to the description i m sure to sound like the beach boys   
the fender 18 feet california clear instrument cable   lake placid blue  is a very good extra cord for a good price 
got this cable to run a rockband keyboard controller to my m audio profire 2626 to control midi in pro tools  works great  firm fit  solidly molded ends  reputable branded cable  a bit on the thin side  but i haven t seen to have any issue due to this or anything  couldn t go wrong for $5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility 
when i was searching for midi cables for my art x 15 foot controller  i came across these hosa ones  and they were $2 dollars each  as they are now $6  i realize i would still be happy with that price as well  as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors  and work flawlessly  you must realize that they are only 5 feet  as i overestimated it and now wish they were longer  for any connection from racked sound modules  this will be perfect 
the ends of the midi cable look and feel like quality  connection is secure  no worries about uneven connections  it also detaches without a hitch  highly recommended 
just trying to find a midi to midi was a task  and you have to make sure the pin config is correct   this one is a good product and works just fine
i bought these to go from my board to the amp  we use them for a mobile church so they take a beating  they are still going strong 
sturdy cord and plugs  inexpensive  good value  i don t require professional level equipment  so this cord serves my purposes well  satisfied with purchase 
use it every week at gigs   solid  no problems with the solder joints   a good quality cable at a very good price 
this was exactly what i was after  i have a voice touch and needed a small cord to connect the mic to the voice touch and this was perfect  before i used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches  i highly recommend this for those who keep the mic on a stand and have a voice touch or other stand connected device for vocals 
i bought these because i really had too long of mike cords for my solo live show  and these are really nice cords if you have a home portastudio recording studio like myself  who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place  i bought two because i use a digitech live 2 harmony processor and two xlr mike cords are required to make it operational  good price here too  hard to find just 10  mike cords  usually longer ones are only obtainable 
i ve used a lot of cables and i always come back to hosa  they are indeed some of the best audio cables in their price range on the market 
nice solid cables  with excellent support at the ends   should last a lifetime of usage no problem and just what i needed to connect my tube preamp 
good quality cable and sounds very good
zero issues with this cable so far   it feels fairly cheap and light weight but it has survived for months of plugging in  unplugging  and packing between practice spaces i ll update this review if when it breaks 
realtively inexpensive patch cable for electric guitar i have had it for a few months and so far it has held up pretty well
i bought this because i wanted a cheap replacement cable for one that had a short  i m pleasantly surprised with this cable  it s decent sound and decent build quality  for a good price 
seems sturdy enough  and no noise issues  so i m pretty much satified with it  it doesn t leave the house so i m not asking it to handle a lot  but with reasonable care it should last a while 
i m not a professional  but have been playing for many  many years   this is the best cord i ve ever had  though i m sure eric clapton has something better 
this hosa cable is very well made  with good quality connectors and a nice long length  my son is expanding his collection of amps and effects pedals so needed additional cables to get everything connected  this 25  cable gives him flexibility to move around and it is sturdy enough that it can take being stepped on and pulled around the cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable highly recommended cfh
bought this for my daughter along with her new guitar  it seems to work well  no issues in the first couple of weeks 
i have found hosa cables to be an excellent value  more expensive cables may be more rugged  but for the price  i m very happy with the hosa s i have purchased 
this is good cable  excellent 1 4&#34  plugs  the lugs and solder joints are covered with heat shrink material  which will hold everything in place for years  grade a+ cable at a very affordable price  definitely  going back for more  the 25 ft  cable was only a couple dollars more than 10 ft 
pretty crappy cable  it works and gets the job done  but after purchasing this product and using it  i will shell out the extra bucks for better quality 
i use this cord in my church to run from my pedalboard to my amp  which is in a soundproof box   the cord is reliable and clean sounding  i like it and have used hosa products in the past with confidence  excellent cord  hopefully this review will be usefull to you 
these cables have taken a beating the last few months  and have served me well with no problems  real metal ends  not molded on  with high quality silicone jackets and strain reliefs at the connectors  
in my opinion it does not hurt to have extra guitar cables around  from experience they tend to just die without notice  i have a feeling this one will last a long time  it is built sturdy and sounds really good i recommend this product 
hosa guitar cables work great  never had any problems with them  i own several of different lengths and they all sound perfect 
this product does exactly what it is supposed to do at a decent price   i have absolutely no complaints   this is my first experience with the brand and i am not disappointed 
good quality guitar cord very low noise  repairable  effective strain releaf thick rubber cover   this is a great buy  under 10 bucks for a quality cord of course i just got it  it might not be durable but it looks durable if i change my mind about anything i will update my review for now  i would say  buy one  joe
this is a good solid cable with no problems  when i m on stage  i like a longer cable but at practice i don t need all the extra length tangleing up on everything   
this guitar cable is very nice   it looks high quality and has the white ends   fantastic deal for this cable 
this item is well built and i like the terminal ends and how they have the spring built in  these aren t going to be the most durable road cables but for home and light road use they will work well 
this amp plug is great for the price its 10 ft long the perfect size for jammin at home and it has a quality look to it aesthetically totally worth the price
hosa cable gtr210 guitar instrument cable   10ft  is a high quality instrument cable  but low cost  won t break the bank  i m very satisfied with my purchase 
this is your basic  black electric guitar cable but it works great   so far the connections at both ends are solid and the sound from the amp is great   nice and rubbery and 10 feet is long enough   if problems arise later with this cable  i will update this review  but as of now there has been no problems whatsoever with this cable 
i never really considered a cheaper cable  i was always taught to get the best i could afford  when this showed up in a cable search on amazon  i jumped on it  i figured i had nothing to lose to my surprise  this is an excellent cable  with good build quality and a strong  thick jacket that inspires confidence  the sound through it is identical to my monster cables  and it cost one quarter the price    hmmmm  guess i should have tried to figure this out myself instead of listening to &#34 snobs&#34  for so many years  i will never do that again this is worth the money twice over  try it out for yourself and kiss overpriced cables goodbye 
hosa makes good stuff  this is no exception  i ve trusted them for years  i can t think if a single hosa cable i ve owned that s failed 
hard to day too much  but it works great  no issues to speak of  it does the job perfectly well
for the price  this works really well  i see no faults  it can unscrew pretty easily  but this is hardly a problem right now 
this cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for  it s quality outweighs its price  let s face it  a cable is a cable is a cable  but the quality of these cables can vary greatly  i replaced a lighter cable with this one and i was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp  i have an ibanez art series guitar into an ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home  with nothing changed but the cable  there was a significant difference in quality and volume  so much so that i checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised  the quality appears good  the ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum i had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential  i ve seen more expensive cables and this one is  so far  great hosa gtr210 guitar cable 10 ft
i was looking for a long cable to perform live with my band and i m glad with hosa quality  it feels reliable and without adding noise 
these are good cables at a good price   not sure they would hold up to heavy use  but for practicing at home they are really great 
very sturdy  high quality with little to no feedback  i use it for performing for my friends and they all love it
unless you re going to go for the very top of the line most expensive professional chords  these will do for any medium sized venue 
i have many lengths of these hosa cables and have neverhad a problem with them i am not an active musician  so have not put any of them throughthe riggers of what happens on stage  so i cannot comment on thistype of usage in my over 40 years  10 of them on stage  i have come to realize  thatyou should always have extra cables  just like strings  with you  aseven the most expensive cables will sometimes let you down 
works great on my 100 watt amp  almost compares to a monster cable  and with its length its plenty of room from your guitar to amp  good product 
good cable  as good as any expensive brand  thick  a bit stiff and seems to be shielded  no complaints at all 
i own lots of hosa cables they are cheap and quality is there  i ve only recieved one bad cable out of around 50 or so  i use a lot of these guys and if they work when you get them  they havn t failed yet 
the cable is great for connecting directly to the computer microphone to record live without a console or mixer       its great  i recomended
bought this to hook up a beta 58 to a panasonic g2 dslr and a kodak zi8 for interviews  works the way it s supposed to  90 degree trs is a nice touch  good price 
just received this cord and it seems to work as expected  what can you say about an adapter cord   it is well made  good construction and sound from my dslr with my mic is superb 
well made  xlr 3 pin adaptor to mini   needed to get a real xlr mic into the computer and this did the job 
the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is   stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones  where left and right are separate unbalanced wires   this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable   this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire   pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire 
first  the reasons why i awarded this five stars  the construction is uniformly excellent  both ends have strain reliefs  the 1 8" connecter perfectly mates with the plug into which i insert it  and the xlr end is a quality component i purchased this specifically to transform the third channels in mypowerwerks 50 watt personal p a  systeminto something more useable  this greatly expands the functionality and versatility of the portable pa by allowing me to plug in another mic  since i have three of those units daisychained i was able to significantly enhance the entire system with this simple adapter another reason why i love this is it s noise free  in some environments in which i play there are sources of electromagnetic interference that cheap cables will pick up and transmit  i have not had that problem with this one  so it s another plus overall i am very pleased with this adapter and actually purchased a spare in case i damage or lose my primary one  it s a bit pricier than others i considered  but i feel that the quality and peace of mind are worth the premium 
i use this cable to run a extra line from microphone podiums to a zoom h1  this adapter has never failed me and has been instrumental in capturing quality audio at live events  i own several of these and love them i highly recommend this adapter to any visual or audio professional  also check out hosa s sinlge xlr to double xlr splitter 
great stereo sound out of the keyboards my keys had a single 1 4&#34  stereo out so this cable was needed to get it to convert to a true 2 channel stereo so we could eq it properly and it worked like a charm  i highly recommend this cable 
another quality product from hosa   just what i needed for an insert patch from my mixer to eq   i always like slightly longer length as i can always zip tie back but hard to stretch   no noise from this cable 
when i ordered these i wasn t expecting a whole lot since the price was under two dollars for a nearly 10 foot cable   it turns out the quality is quite excellent and these cables are not flimsy at all   i plugged them into the mixer and waited to hear some static  interference or buzz to explain the low price and all i got was a nice  clean signal   highly recommend these to anyone with a mixer that needs an insert cable 
these are solid cables    tight fit in receptacles  no introduction of noise  and no discernible loss of signal  especially considering the price  these are brilliant  i was like some of the reviewers wondering if such an economical cable could be any good  but i trusted their judgment and gave these a try and so count me in among those who weren t sure but have become convinced that hosa knows how to make a great cable  and to do so without the need to charge monster prices 
on my mixer  i have send returns on the same plug using a 3 wire trs with send on the tip  return on the ring  and a common ground   but my effects boxes like to have separate 1 4" tr ins and outs this is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkbehringer shark fbq100 automatic feedback destroyerto the 1202 vlz3 s send returnsmackie 1202 vlz3 12 ch  compact recording sr mixeri probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send return 
i still operate in an analog environment quite often  so i end up using lots of inserts  i have 8 channels of compression  limiter  gate and expander  plus various eqs and effects processors that need to be routed and applied to specific channels  i have an insert snake that i use as well  but the individual insert cables  of differing lengths  that i carry are lifesavers that make me a more efficient soundman during setup and a more flexible soundman during the show 
i use these in my home studio as inserts and they work great  no complaints on a side note  i always clean all my cables with caig deoxit gold g5 spray contact conditioner 5 oz and hightly recommend it to all musicians  you will hear the differnce  i also spray a q tip and and clean all the jacks on my guitars and instruments 
when you need an audio insert cable  you need an audio insert cable we custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound reinforcement fixed installations   for  mobile rigs  such as mixer cases with processing gear  it s simply not cost effective  and hosa is our go to brand for reliability and durability   there are other brands  but our reputation is at stake hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation  while lowering our labor costs  thanks for such a dependable product  hosa   thanks for such a great price  amazon 
i play my i pod through a small guitar amp   great way to wake up the kids   works perfectly for the purpose   keep in mind small end for i pod is stereo and large end that goes into amp in mono   if needing a stereo jack at both ends get something else 
plugged it in and it works to connect a mono line out to the stereo input on a lepai amp  not much else i can tell you
i bought a few of these to hook ipods iphones to live stage sound systems  most of which are not in stereo anyway  so why use stereo to mono adapters or 2 separate channels when it s not needed  perfect solution  seems durable 
i carry this in my bass gig bag so i can plug my phone into the mono aux input on the back of my genz benz bass head  handy for rehearsals when the band needs to listen to a track while working out an arrangement  my bass cab is full range fearful 15 6 1   before picking this up  i used a couple of cables   adapters to go from stereo 1 8&#34   to mono 1 4&#34  and it often seemed i never had quite what i needed on hand 
it s hard not to love a cord that carries electrons all the way to the end  not sure what  other than complete failure would take stars away 
cables are cables  they usually all work  and with amazon  you will always find the best deals for the same quality 
picked up a cable to test on my new pedalboard  and i couldn t be happier  doesn t suck tone  cables are sturdy  and they sound great  this replaced a normal straight 1 4 inch cable and saves so much space on my board 
if you need some 6" cables to connect your pedals  look no farther  these cables are perfect  they deliver good sound  are very small  and very cheap  what more could you ask for  
bought this hosa pedal cable for our son to interconnect his guitar pedal  it works well and seems to be durable  it hasn t given him any problems so far  it doesn t appear to change the sound quality or tone  great product 
good little connector cable   well constructed  durable  built to last   i would recommend this cable to connect stomp boxes  worth it 
these are great cables  the only con i could give is if they go bad   no opening up the ends to fix them  but in my experience they are durable  most people are using these on a pedal board so there s not a lot of movement to wear them down 
exactly what i needed to connect 2 distortion paddles to my amp   do yourself a favor  always order threw amazon dealers  i placed an order threw onlinecarstereo com and had to report a scam operation to my credit card co    their customer reviews were terrible  yet i made the mistake of placing n order   right before my eyes they changed their bad reviews to add good ones    
these are great patch cables especially for the price  they don t suck any tone they are reliable i ve had mine for 2 years and are really great for players on a budget 
this is a very good cable  i don t forsee having any problems with it  it s just right for hooking my pedals together eithout the mesws of long cables  if you need this get it  the price is right and shipping was right on time 
this is not the fanciest cable you can buy  but it fits my low budget   it works perfectly  it doesn t feel like its going to break anytime soon  and my pedals are perfectly connected 
i typically use planet waves cables but tried these and there just as great  never an issue  no loss of tone  never breaks or fails  quality product for a good price 
really just some inexpensive and yet durable cables to link your stompboxes together  as of yet  i havent had one go all crackly  which  considering they get frequent use  is pretty good  often  cheap cords die within a year or so  every electric guitarist keeps a stock of these things  and this one in particular is cheap and accessible  i probably have around twelve of them enjoy 
hosa patch cables are the best for the buck  great sound and flexible  i m a firm hosa cable fan  love these little guys 
these have a lower profile and can fit and bend into the places the ones with thick metal ends can t 
i use this adapter on the interface mix board end of 1 channel of my xlr cable snake  to change 1 channel into my monitor return  i plug an xlr to female 1 4" stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup  now i can record with 6 channels  and monitor with 2   it s an 8 channel xlr snake   why do i go through all that you ask  because i have an 8 channel xlr snake  and instead of buying another snake  why not adapt the snake i have  hence the word adapter      p i love it  it s a great tool to add versatility to your setup  no matter what you re doing  definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an xlr to balanced 1 4" stereo    it s high quality  and very solid  i definately expect this to last me a long time 
i purchased this to work with my ion system and my shure mic  arrived as expected  very solid great fit  it works    
this has come in handy many times in my studio z108 net  we love having it around  good quality affordable price 
its affordable and it works   its a nice little adapter for your low impedance cable to your high impedance input 
for the price  can t beat it   works as well as any $15   $20 one i would have bought at local guitar stores 
just a basic female xlr to 1 4 inch male adapter  i use these so i can plug my regular mic cables into my keyboard practice all in one pa 
as expected from hosa another great product   solid construction and great sound reproduced   i would recomed this product to everyone 
i use this to run a single  mono xlr shotgun mic line to two audio channels on my tascam dr 40  which saves me a step in post production   the quality is fine and it does what it s supposed to do   good price for a good product 
this is a solid product  i ended up not needing it so    i returned it  however  it worked fine and gets the job done 
this dual splitter works perfect  i own a live event video company and i shoot a lot of weddings  the most important part of video is the audio  you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal  i always say  half of video is audio  for years i used to run a line directly out of the dj s mixer to get my audio  the issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking  often though  the signal is to hot  the music is crap  or the dj says something stupid  with just the dj s voice i can edit the way i want and compress time  this product has improved my productions beyond it s price sold  i use them to run a separate clean audio line from a dj s wireless systems to my own audio recorder  they work perfectly and haven t failed me once 
this was recommended to me by the top engineer at genz benz bass amplification company   andy said that this product is far superior to any other   he was right   fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my shuttle 6 0 amp   also fixed the effects loop jacks  which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose 90% of its power on gigs   not good   after several gigs worth of testing  both problems are resolved   andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating  cleaning and coating effect on the components   wow   and no  andy does not own stock in  have affiliation with  or represent in any way the manufacturers of de oxit   nor do i 
this thing is like a magic spray  hah seriously    i used this on noisy hinges  car doors  etc i really bought it to clean the pots  volume controls and knobs  on my guitars  pedals and equipment  it really does work and gets rid of the static noise you get when you turn your volume control on your radio or guitar for example 
i bought this product to use on my amp pots  it restored the sound power and clearity of my amps it doesn t evaporate right away  but after a couple of minutes your good to go 
before you pay some tech to fix the knobs and switches on your guitar  stomp box or amp  try this   95% of the time  this will take care of the problem   if your amp cuts in and out  also try spraying the effects loop and pushing a 1 4&#34  jack in and out of the socket a dozen times   the very first can i bought probably paid for itself a hundred times over   good stuff  
i deal with quite a bit of electronic musical instrument gear from guitars  basses  amps  fx  midi gear  etc   over time most of it starts suffering from scratchy   noisy pots  knobs   input and output jacks that are crackly  etc in the past i ve tried some locktite electronics cleaner  which is provided in a similar can  it would rarely work in contrast this has cleaned every piece of gear i ve used it on saving me from having to physically replace the pots and jacks  it s really like magic in a can 
this stuff works great and is well worth the price  i used it to clean the pots on several guitars and a bass amp along with various effect pedals  no more scratchiness  no more jarring volume spikes  all my knobs glide now better than the day they were new  i ll always keep a can of this around  nothing more to say  great stuff 
fantastic stuff    i sprayed it in my bass guitar s pot and now its like new  wish i had found this stuff sooner 
what was it  brillcream  a dab will do ya something like that  this is all you need for contact cleaning  worth the coin 
i used this on my guitar tone and volume pots and it clears up the crackle feels a little oily  but gets the job done and you don t have to replacethe potentiometers 
use this alot on all kinds of electronics  it gets crackling knobs going again  i ve use it for years  recommend
the pots on my bass has become &#34 scratchy&#34  so i sprayed a bit into them  turn the pots back and forth a few times and no more noise  great for what i needed 
for the money  this karaoke mic does a decent job for any vocal use  good to keep as a spare in the gig box 
i was truly surprised when i saw how nice it was  has weight to it  and has good sound   looks nicely made very good deal for the money  can t go wrong    not a very cheep made microphone    much better then i thought it would be     its nice 
we bought this mic and a spare for our son s guitar amp set up for his mixer  it seems to work fine  and comes with the mic cord  we decided to go for the model with the on=off switch based on other reviews  and haven t yet been disappointed 
there s nothing complicated about this purchase  it s a cable  it works  it doesn t cost a lot  it s a great deal  get it i use it every week  and it still sounds perfect  then  again  i never mistreat my equipment 
i only do test recording with this digitally to get a better idea of my learning process from the other side  it gives a clean crisp reproduction of every flaw i have 
i use this for video exchanges on a guitar instruction website  it s perfect for vocals  podcasting  video recording and so forth  shure makes excellent stuff  what s also great is you save some money as an xlr cable is included  i m very happy with this purchase 
this microphone is great for singing with a pa and an electric guitar  i sing worship praise songs and southern gospel and it is very smooth in the mid range and when you get up close it enhances the bass nicely  i don t think it is the same as an sm58 but it is exactly what i need  built to last and it is a shure 
just got this  have used it for recording and rehearsal  it works well so far and i will revise the review if that somehow changes in the next few years   right now  though  i d say great product 
good mic for simple live stuff that isn t too expensive   it gets a good clear sound and has an on off switch that helps with all kinds of things
this is a proven classic   using it to mic my mesa boogie mark v 1x12 cabinet   sounds fantastic and is solidly built 
this is the #1 mic you should get  recording or live  instruments or voice  it always come through  with a great sound and seems almost indestructible looking forward to work with it on future projects  can t believe it took me so long to get one of those
although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic  that was not always the case and i ve actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when i bought my first one which was then known as a "shure model 545 unidyne iii "  that mic got stolen about 2 years ago  but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and i was still using it when i needed one with an on off switch function   i ve owned or used countless modern day sm 58 s and sm 57 s along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers   i have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and i don t need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a sm 57   to me the sm 57 sounds similar to the $469 shure sm 7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away   i d only use an sm 7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive   by design the sm 58 s require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the sm 57 s   i prefer the sm 57 s over the sm 58 s for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end   the sm 57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled   the sm 57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic i ve ever used   if you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the sm 58   if you are ever going to use an sm 57 for vocals i d recommend buying the shure a2ws windscreen with it   that genuine shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the sm 57   the sm 57 will pop like mad without one   the only possible drawback to the sm57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on off switch these days   i can t find a modern sm 57 with a switch anywhere   however  if you ve ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability  for my money  the sm 57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes   for studio vocals i d use an sm 7  which really doesn t sound all that much different from the sm 57 when the built in variable eq on the sm 7 is set the way i like   the sm 57 and it s predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable   you can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen 
good all around mike  if you are looking for a solid mike to start your studio  i recommend this one  best used for guitar and mid range instrument recording but not bad on vocals  best mike for the price and purpose 
seriously   the shure sm57 sets the standard  which by all other instrument microphones are judged no kidding   they work great with guitar  for a real acoustic guitar sound  drums  congas  tablas    you name it    if it s an instrument the sm57 delivers i hear it s good for vocals as well   when the president gives a speech  the sm57 is there in my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the sm57   the sm58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection  most wannabe s  for instrument sound reinforcement     bar none    the best 
if it s good enough to track tom petty s vox on the heartbreakers albums  its good enough for the rest of us  sounds great on amps and perc  dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%  my drummer still uses it on his kit and i never told him haha  hope he doesn t read this review   it s a shame the new mics coming out  wireless stuff they make  ie presentor  pg seies  digital series etc  are such flimsy pieces of garbage  this is the last of the cool from shure 
there s a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these  and if it doesn t  it should    this is a great all purpose dynamic mic  i use it for instruments  vocals  even field recording sometimes   the sm58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals  but that doesn t mean that the 57 can t handle a voice   they re pretty much the same mic as far as i m concerned  and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner i think you ll find the same thing   and if you re operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably  then you probably already know what you re looking for   i ll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon  but if you re like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics  you can t go wrong here 
i use this for recording guitars as well as live vocals   i ve knocked this microphone around a decent amount  and it is plenty rugged   i couldn t be happier with it 
i bought this for my teen son for christmas  he loves to play his bass and sing along  he had a different shure mic and it was totally flat compared to this particular model  nice and clean sounds  plus it seems pretty sturdy  we did get him a mic stand and it fits on it perfectly and stays put  shure knocked this one out of the park 
these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs    an all around tough mic    great for all your needs   i highly recommend them  
the industry standard for live performance  the sm58 has withstood the test of time and for good reason  these are the only microphones that i perform with  and the on off switch makes it easier so i don t have to power down all of my gear when i am done practicing   i just turn the mic off 
legendary performance indeed  works perfectly  extremely easy to set up  very good sound  good price  that s  bout all you need to know 
great all around mic used for vocals   no frills  tough as nails  and great sound for live music   if you re buying your first mic  or switching from a cheapie  and intend to use it for singing vocals  this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation   i ve never used another one since the first time i switched from a cheaper mic  that came with some bundle  10 years ago   i depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds i like perfectly   you can stand 3 feet away and really wail  or get up close for some bass response  or anything in between the sm58 cn comes with the mic  25 ft cable  cable tie  carry pouch  and mic clip   the standard sm58 does not have a switch  one less thing to break and i don t miss it   but the sm58 s does have it for a few dollars extra 
i ve just got the shure sm58 microphone as expected  this is a real workhorse of microphones  the sound is clear  crispy  robust  high quality product also  i ve bought it at amazon and they sold through j&r  music and computer world which is an excellent supplier  they shipped in less time than expected i m a really happy customer now 
no complaints here  the quality is great  the sounds is excellent  and my voice sounds wonderful and crisp  use it all the time 
a nice addition to my recording home studio   i recommend it for any one who records ballads or light classical music 
i made the mistake of thinking i could save forty bucks and get by with the shure pg 58   i m no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp  rather than a p a    whatever the reason  the pg 58 simply doesn t have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the roland cube   peavey amps i try to employ it with  i use a 1 4" adapter with the xlr connector that comes with the mic    when i borrow a shure sm 58 mic from someone  the difference is instant and dramatic  it s a far more efficient  i e  louder  mic  producing a full  clear sound  and without additional pre amplification  demonstrating why it s the most popular microphone in the world   for five bucks extra  i can t fathom a reason for avoiding the sm 58s  the version with an on off switch   it s a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pick up of "private" comments by indiscreet band members   and even if you re an instrumentalist  it may be wiser to select the sm 58 over the sm 57   the former mic is a little more ostentatious  but it s also slightly more adaptable  and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non musical sounds  above all  the sm 58 has proven itself to be the sherman tank of microphones  simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durability  i see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of "this seller "  perhaps a good point unless it s in reference to amazon prime  which is the shure sm 58 of commerce  competitive prices  no postage  easy returns   but anyone who returns an sm58 probably had no business buying it in the first place   they are the populous drones of the industry  invariably purchased by professionals who know first hand what they re getting  reliability and virtual indestructibility   in fact  it s the very popularity of the sm58 that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators   consumers require choice  but with the shure sm58 there need be none  
this is a well made  low noise and low cost cable  unless you make a lot of money with your recordings  this will do just fine 
didn t know what to expect for under $10  but it proved to be worth the gamble this cable appears to be well constructed and it works fine for me amateur use  infrequent setup teardowns  it s a decent 15 feet long  and has a locking button on the female end i m quite happy with it 
everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another   i have a personal preference for the xlr ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside  first to slide down the cable  with a 4 legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters   unfortunately that design isn t used here  but i chose to award the 5 star rating for value because you get 15  of good quality shielded cable with 2 xlr ends  m and f  for well under $1 ft as for pinout it s straightforward  pin 1 is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends  while pins 2 and 3 are run isolated between both ends   the end design chosen uses the single set screw connector  the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart  and the rubber bumper design on the back which i haven t had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with  however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineer s kit because they will be used not if but when the need arises another favorite of mine is the 6 pack of 3 foot male to female cables which do use my favorite xlr ends mentioned above  which amazon will rush you gls audio 3ft patch cable cords   xlr male to xlr female black cables   3  balanced snake cord   6 pack  these are very easy to open an end  change phase  lift ground  or input someone s oddball source signal   having 6 on hand means you won t quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix back to pyle s product here  i basically took away 1 star for not using the easy to open and re wire xlrs but gave them a star for value in the product since it s 15 feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot   it s also great when someone yells "it s too short i need a cable stretcher at the podium " and quickly adds 15 feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasn t planned for or got moved quit working   for the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing i finally equipped my cable kit with the usual xlr to  rca  1 4 trs  hi z transformers  and the above mentioned 6 pack of 3 foot cables to quickly gain access to the xlr terminals if need be  plus 2 of these 15 foot cables mainly to solve distance problems  and a roll of gaffer s tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards   i used to have 2ea 50 foot xlr cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now i have one left for my kit  with all that i had to build an emergency xlr to 2 5mm ts all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin   even though all this was under $100 it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on  so a bit of "what if" thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner s daugher s toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic my last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made   it will no doubt be needed again  and since you made it you ll know why  how  and where it was used before  thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem   people think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position   my only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didn t serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted xlr 4 pin stereo y splitter to dual trs female cable i made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry   i chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal  wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when i setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that  stereo  channel in rehersal at the console 
this is a great chord for anyone needing to not spend the money on a high quality chord    it s no peavey but it works just as good   
i bought a pair of these cables and they work just fine   there doesn t seem to be any noise and they seem to be built to last   they do what they re supposed to do 
well made and the perfect length for my needs  the shielding was great as well  the end connectors were well made and strong 
like most products on the market  depending on where and how the item is used  your experience may vary  for me  this cable is going to be used on a semi stationary mic stand in my project studio  and thus far  it s done nothing but an exceptional job  i tested the cable with a few different mics and in each scenario  the signal was just as strong as the some of the other  more pricey cables out there  would i purchase this again  absolutely 
the extra length gives me more flexibility and maneuverability   cord works well and hasn t been any problem  to date   plugs directly to the system  or my mini amp   works well 
i have to tell you guys  these xlr cables that i have received recently are by far the best quality cables i have ever encountered in my entire music  professional  life i would suggest these cables to any one of my colleagues 
got a packet to try but i found they are better than the gator screws that came with my case  my equipment is very secure  highly recommended 
they are screws  they screw in and hold things  to say that they did less would ve gotten the 1 star  i like them 
excellent rack screws with washers  its fit very good to rack holes  good presentation and well packed  i will buy again 
so far the ones i have used have all threaded nicely into our 16u rack  there are exactly as described and do the job  what more can a guy say about a little box of screws  maybe i should post some pics of the little buggers in action 
pros   they look very nice   they cause much less wear than the 2nd hand rack screws and washers cons   more expensive and i had to wait a few days longer than it took my rack equipment to ship i d purchase these again  but i now have 25 but only need 16 at the most once my rack is filled 
i replaced all the stock mounting screws that came with our sound rack cabinet with these  as they were nearly invisible with the black rails and mounting plates  the plastic washers also seem to protect the finishes better than metal washers on the equipment i mounted  inexpensive  and worth it 
donr be fooled by the imitations    should be their slogan  there are some real junky ones out there and these are great  love the washers  life savers  thanks 
great rack mount screws  rubber washers are perfect  lets it give your item that tight fit without worry of the screws working out any time soon  i use them on my portable desktop rack with my mobile dj equipment and they have held strong 
other than that  when you need 10 32 rack screws  these are the real mccoy   wide enough pan to grab the ear  narrow enough to clear that next piece of gear   thanks  raxxess 
there are other rack screws out there  but raxxess makes the best quality screws and soft washers available 
well if this review survives the censors just know that these are great screws when you run out of the original screws you were supplied with your new rack   they work 
mics are like pants  you have to find the right fit  this one i like for my vocals live  i sing fairly low and airy   works great for me  also used to mic resonator guitar through a tube mic preamp live  very sweet sound  i prefer it to the 58  seems a bit more bright and natural  might purchase another one eventually   
why drive a pinto when you can drive a cadillac  this is the industries best mic as far as i am concerned  i had a shure sm 58 like everyone else owned but there is no comparison between this mic and a sm58  sm 58 is garbage compared to the beta 58a  spring for the extra bucks and be happy  that s what i always say 
i have one of these  as well as several other microphones  the sm58 is a good all around mic   the reason it s an industry standard go to  but the beta 58a is a better  in my opinion  vocal specific mic   basically giving  again  in my opinion  a higher quality sound  the sm58 by comparison sounds muffled muddy  where the beta58a is clearer  stronger  and more articulate  if you re used to the sm58  then the beta58a can sound thin and harsh  but  that is adjustable at the board   end result is that it s a tighter sounding mic with more clarity pattern wise  it does better at rejecting unwanted sounds   i play drums and use this mic for that reason  is that it picks up less of my drums than a sm57 or a sm58 
yes  it costs considerably more than the sm58 and i m not sure if i could pass a comparison test between the two  but i love this mic   to me  it sounds slightly brighter and clearer than the 58s i have used in the past   if you are a musician who is strapped for cash or trying to make ends meet  get the 58   if you have the extra dough and want a confidence boost  go for the beta   i would buy this again 
i m an amateur sound tech  we ve been using sm58 in our church for years now and our singers song leaders liked it very much than the other mics that we ve had before  our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this beta58a because of the good reviews  when i received it i cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah   for me  it sounded better than sm58  my songleaders have tested it and guess what    they dont want to use the sm58 anymore   
while the shure sm58lc shure sm58 vocal microphone seems to be the running staple for live performance vocals  and rightly so due to its comparative value and amazing quality in sound and craftsmanship  the beta 58a needs to be given its due  the beta 58a is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin  that is  the beta 58a  in the confined live scenarios in which i have utilized it  has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues  for vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high  or  really  any  notes the beta is a dream  this same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or "popping" complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into it while i wish that i had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon  i can confidently say that the beta 58a is the best vocals microphone that i have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment  quite honestly  i would not be at all surprised if the beta compared well even in confined recording situations  the bottom line is that the beta 58a might be more expensive than its popular cousin  the sm58  but it is worth every penny  anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority  six out of five stars 
the beta 58a along with the original sm58 are industry standards  that s well known  as a general purpose workhorse for live vocals they are by far the most popular tools out there  quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their go to house mics  in fact  i noticed betas all over the place at a small theater  with a high end system  that i played at just recently i had used the old 58 for years before moving to the beta and there is certainly a noticeable difference between the two  the beta is definitetly hotter  with a more sensitive response  your vocals will cut into the mix strongly and with more clarity than you might be used to  mids and highs are picked up perfectly when singing a few inches away and there is a subtle low frequency roll off to avoid that boomy  muddled sound you typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close  you definitely need to stay within a close range though as the pickup pattern is very tight  this is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected "built like a tank" is probably a bit overused when describing products but shure s vocal mics truly earn that title  they can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter  toss it around  drop it  bury it under other stuff  etc   no problem  when you are maintaining a bunch of music gear  it s nice to have tools that you never worry about  for that reason  i d highly recommend getting a used one if you can find a deal  chances are  its in working order no matter what 
i actually replaced a boss tr2 with this pedal  does everything it is supposed to do without the "perceived"  that s was they say  volume loss typical of many tremolo pedals  if it s perceived  then how do you explain how good this sounds  i have since had the pedal rehoused in a metal enclosure with a better switch because i was scared of breaking its plastic housing when switching it on and off 
when i first started setting up my little studio  i wanted something that didn t break the budget   i tried a couple different combo pedal boards   digitech 500  boss me 70   but quickly realized i wasn t getting my sound and the money was quickly drying up   with not much left  i tried a tuna melt as an example of danelectro   who would think   this thing is stunning in its ability to manufacture vintage tremolo sounds  as are most of this line of pedals   i now own about 12 14 of these of all types  and have never been dissapointed save it s very hard to chain them without a lot of noise then i got into guitar building  and they all got put away   lately  i have been trying to make time to improve my playing skills  and joy of joys  i am rediscovering all these pedals and i absolutely love them forget the fab series  they are not so hot   buy the old style as the tuna melt  or the big metal ones like the dan echo   you will not be sorry 
it is exactly what you need in a capo  you can cover all six strings  move one string over to get a drop d tuning or turn the capo upside down to get a partial capo  though a bit of adjusting may be needed to get the strings held down   all in all  a great capo that is well made and will last forever kyser is an awesome small christian company and i really like their products and supporting them with my purchases    
love these capos and nice that you can get them in other colours   prevents you from getting yours confused with some one elses 
my son needed a capo  expensive at music  shop where he takes lessons   at amazon found what he wanted at reasonable price 
i like it  it works well with my takamine acoustic jasmine s35 guitar  and it looks good  overall  i recommend 
quick to clip on and off  really    is there anything else to say  what else do you want it to do these suckers are wonderfully reliable i ve had one for about 10 years  the only thing that went wrong with it was the removable rubber on the "bottom" of the capo became damaged because of my own neglect  however  for a $1  keyser sent me a bag of a about 6 of them  can you go wrong  no great product 
this capo looks great and does the job  it does take a bit of pressure to open the camp  but its better then the winding versions 
purchased the 6 string kyser capo when i meant to get the 12 string version  slightly longer  stronger spring    but find that this 6 string capo not only works great on my 2 6 string acoustics  but also works on my 12 string acoustic with a little adjusting   quality seems top notch  design is simple and effective 
i ve owned the same one for 10 years and it s still going strong after many gigs  the spring tension is just right 
basically because they are the easiest to squeeze in my opinion   i have big hands which may be part of it 
high quality hassle free design   very quick and easy to install and remove in a hurry and dosn t mar the finish or use excessive force   but strong enough to move the capo all the way close to the next fret closer to the headstock to allow maximum room for my fingers without any buzzing   very happy with this purchase 
i ve seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but i ve never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this kyser one   it is by far the best i ve ever seen and i ve been using it for years now and it still works fine   it makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn t corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years very highly recommended 
it is very well made  is easy to use  and holds down the strings just fine   it is well protected as to not scratch or nick your guitar 
durable  affordable  easy to grasp and use 
this capo is as good as i ve ever used and its in pink which perfectly matchs my shell pink strat  great deal 
easy to usegreat quality and i am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand  thank you very much
i ve played guitar for 5 years  seen many different capos  but none that quite satisfies me as the kyser you really can t go wrong with this capo  it is very mobile  easily adjustable  sturdy  and durable what s good about this capo is that you can use it as a regular 6 string capo and still turn it around to use it asa cut capo  the transparent rubber piece does the same job it comes in different colors also i own the black  silver  gold  and camo kyser capos i also own the cut capo for other styles i recommend it all the capos i ve had from kyser are still in great conditions use them all the time at church and at home
i started using kyser capos a couple of years ago and have never looked back since  i now own several of them and have not had any problems with any of them  they work great on acoustic and electric guitars and they have survived the many children i teach lessons to even though they get treated rather rough at times  great capos  you won t be disappointed 
i originally bought this for my guitar and it worked very well for that  so i tried it out on my 4 string uke and it works just as great  it s so much better than the elastic capos  so  it s doing double duty and going strong 
this style of capo can throw your guitar out of tune if you don t put it on right  when used correctly though  it does it s job just fine 
i can only repeat what everyone else has already said  this kyser capo is designed and built very well  it s easy to put on and adjust  and just as easy to take off  there are probably a few capos out there that are a bit flashier  but this is still pretty stylish  and the price makes it a real bargain 
i bought a 12 string one in blk   love it for simplicity and needed it so i didn t have to keep searching for the other   got gold to remind me it is for six strings 
i have used a few different capo s this is far and away my favorite  very easy to take it off  holds the strings tight  what more can you ask for  does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive 
it does what it says  it a kyser quick change capo  this capo is great for changing keys in the middle of a song or anytime you are in a hurry  highly recommended 
i am very pleased with this purchase  the strings play very clearly with zero buzzing on any position between frets  i can dramatically hear and feel the difference than when i used a cheap $5 capo before  this is well worth your pay   
my husband usese this capo almost everytine he plays his guitar  his old one lasted about 10 years  worth the cost 
long time shubb user  but decided to try something different i think i ve found how lazy i am  i ended up using the kyser more often than the shubb because of the fact that you can put the kyser on the peghead reaching my hand to an always available position on guitars  i e  the peghead  for the kyser turns out to be much more convenient than reaching to something that is not on the guitar and that could change according to situations  e g  maybe just by my side on the sofa in my living room  maybe a table or the floor in some other places  for the shubb 
these capos are wonderful  perfect all the way around  long lasting and backed up by the company  i have three 
i bought this capo for mywashburn d10  it works on my orlando classical guitar as well  i wanted a capo that was simple to operate and wasn t too expensive   and the kyser quick change guitar capo fits the bill nicely  update 7 25 10  my orlando guitar was stolen  boo hoo      easy on  easy offthe spring mechanism makes it easy to put the capo on or take it off   rubberized clampsrubberized clamps helps prevent the kyser from scratching or marring the neck and the frets   ergonomicthe arched arm with the weird looking loopy looking thingy and the other straight arm help you to firmly grab on to them without slipping so you can easily and quickly remove or reposition the kyser capo   durablethe kyser is made from durable aluminum  update 7 25 10  i ve had this capo for almost 3 years and it s still working like a champ   according to amazon s instant order update for moi  i got this capo on  november 22  2007    the same capo colbie caillat used in bubblycheck out the music video  it s the same capo colbie caillat used inbubbly    the kyser quick change guitar capo is excellent  i don t think you can go wrong with this one 
probably the best kapo out on the market  very high quality and a sleek look  easy to use  what more could you want 
i use the capo for my guitar and it sounds awesome  i like to put the capo on the first fret and when i play a song i made  it sounds really really good  the capo is very easy to use as well 
the package arrived on time  this is the best capo around and works great  does what it is supposed to do 
works great  just clip it on and jam out forget the screw on type  and spend the few extra bux for this one   you ll be happier  trust me 
i chose the patriotic design for obvious reasons   it is lovely   clear shard silk screening   the capo itself is really good   it is very snug on the strings 
i got pink cause nobody would steal it  and we all know how often capos get stolen from people pink is great
this capo is awesome  it looks and feels very nice and premium  it works on all of my guitars not much more you can ask for 
these are good for the average guitar player who doesn t want to much strain or pain on there fingers  not the fullest tone  but you wouldn t expect that with extra light strings 
i have an electro acoustic martin  second hand but without a scratch   i got it with  13 strings and well  is simply too much  is good to play rithyms but can t do pretty much nothing else i have installed a set  i got 8  and it sounds really good  not as solid as the  13 but now i have more range to do solos and go up and down much easier recomended
strings are not just strings  guitar strings are another very important part of playing great guitar  and all martin products are second to none 
i replaced a set of strings that were very used with these martins   they are  as named  very light   they are easy on my fingers and give great tone   quality company  great strings  great price 
i ordered a couple sets of this strings so i would have some extras for myself and my 6 year old son who is just starting out on guitar  this strings have good sound and hold a tune well  the best thing is the price is great  like i said i am usinging these on mine and my sons guitar and my son was breaking string from playing to hard  but with these string it does not break the bank to replace them as needed 
the name martin says it all & has for many many years grab some extras because you will want more  great price great strings 
i love these strings  and use them for all of my acoustic playing  best of all  i can find them here for $3 49 per set  so i m not dumping a bunch of money on strings all the time  easy to play  and they sound great long lasting if you take care of them by wiping them down every time 
these strings provide a warm crisp tone that makes any dreadnought guitar sound like heaven i use them all the time
good strings with good sound the extra light is easier on the fingers   but they sound thinner too go for the light gauges for more solid sound if you can handle the pressure
