i bought this to use with my keyboard  i wasn t really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals  it doesn t work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano  which is what i d always used  doesn t have the same feel either  nowhere close in my opinion  a sustain pedal like the m audio sp 2 sustain pedal with piano style action or other similar pedal is a much better choice  the price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better  the only thing i ve found the yamaha fc 5 sustain pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where i keep my electric guitar pedals 
i didn t expect this cable to be so thin  it s easily 1 2 the thickness of any guitar cable i ve used  not sure about long term durability or signal loss interference  if i had the foresight i d spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable   still  it works and was inexpensive edit  6 months later and it s dead already   wire frayed at the right angle jack   you get what you pay for 
i bought this for my canon vixia hf g10 video camera and a shotgun mic that i recently purchased for it  i needed a 12&#34  wire for it to be a perfect fit from my mic  which is mounted on the mini advanced shoe  to the microphone plug on the video camera   the wire on this thing is  not  1 foot long  the actual wire is under 8&#34  long itself  i would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it wasn t worth the hassle    i d have rated it 1 star  but i tried it on my nikon d3200  shoe mounted shotgun mike  and it worked out ok  still a tight fit though  since there s only 8&#34  of wire    i d recommend anyone looking for a short cable go with a 2  adapter  worst case scenario  you can zip tie a loop instead of getting angry that it doesn t fit also  not sure if it s the wire  so this didn t affect stars  but i hear a hiss when recording  again  unsure if it s the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the dslr or not  or my shotgun mic  
i got 3 of these to plug xlr cables into the 1 4&#34  jacks on my board  i got it because my board only has 6 channels with xlr inputs  none of them work  perhaps i got the wrong thing 
the handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar  and i feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it s unpleasant to use   hurts the fingers  it s cheap and easy to use  it ll do the job  but i don t like it 
it s good but think its a bit expensive for just one they should give you two for that price or lower the price
the epiphone les paul guitars don t particularly sound that great  but they stay in tune much better than the cheap squier strat you can get at the same or lower price  if your kid is serious about wanting to play guitar  but you re not completely sure if they will stick with it  if you can spend another $100 and get a used mexican made fender strat or tele  the reason for this is because for 1  if they decide it s not something they want to do anymore  you can resell it at the same price you bought it for  as long as it is still in decent condition  and little no money is lost  second  if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a &#34 better&#34  or more high end guitar  mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use  i have a couple different high end guitars and i will not get rid of my mexy strat because it sounds great still  i ll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this 
from greg abrams review  entitled "for all but the tone snobs " a review further down on this product s page "alright  so you want to get a good  if somewhat "basic"  distortion sound for less than $100  this is your deal "i strongly disagree   you can find much better distortions for $100 or less  even a few near or under the $40 mark the ds 1 is currently priced at i ve played guitar for over 10 years   like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the ds 1   afterall  everyone talks about them  they re available at any given music store in the nation  you hear about all these famous musicians using them  plus a ds 1 is actually pretty cheap   so i snapped one up just like everyone else   come to find out that just because something is popular  that doesn t always mean its good  see  nickelback  the transformers movie franchise  the kardashian family  etc     so i plugged it in and didn t really care for it   the distortion was harsh  thin  artificial sounding and always noisy   i tried it on both my amps  my practic amp  a solid state fender frontman 25r  and my big amp  the b 52 at100  which is a 100w tube halfstack  it was was not very diverse  and the basic sound was not very likeable to me   i ve read the japanese made ds 1 s are better in sound than the newer  made in taiwan models but  either way  the ds 1 is just not a great pedal in my mind but  like many newer players  i didn t know any better at the time   fast forward a few years and i ve bought and sold literally dozens of pedals   there is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open so here are some pedals i currently own that i like much better than the ds 1   all of them are great general purpose distortions  easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops  and can  at the time of this writing  be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol  amazon com  and are rugged enough to last for years boss ds 2 turbo distortion   lest i catch any flames from people thinking i m a boss hater  i m certainly not  i loved the tu 3  the odb 3  the md 2  and the xt 2  among others  i ll start with the ds 1 s big brother   this pedal has a much nicer tone to it  not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes   the i setting is pretty much a higher quality ds 1  the ii setting is a brighter  richer tone   as the ds 1 completely overshadows the ds 2 in popularity  you can find ds 2 s all over ebay for very cheap prices   a very worthy pedal  unfortunately overlooked by many pro co rat2   great dirty distortion pedal   probably my personal favorite   you ve heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years  its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists   its a rich  full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy   i ve never heard a bad tone out of mine  its great for getting a "big amp" kind of sound out of a small practice amp   its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume   a truly excellent pedal ehx little big muff   the big muff is another pedal you ve heard on hundreds of songs   its kind of a fuzz  kind of a distortion  but definitely owns its own sonic territory   very big  saturated and warm   used heavily in the 70 s for classic rock tones  also in the 90 s and beyond for tons of grunge and garage   used by everyone from carlos santana and david gilmour to the smashing pumpkins  dinosaur jr  and jack white   i personally reccomend the little big muff  not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent nyc reissue  its smaller  uses a regular 9v adapter and its cheaper   a great pedal mxr distortion +   the distortion + is a great first distortion  and can usually be found pretty cheap   whats nice about the distortion + is that it sounds great on anything  and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent  i e  you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp  it doesn t cover over your equipments sound   used by quite a few famous folks  including the greatful deads jerry garcia  randy rhoads  ozzy s famous guitarist  and steve jones of the sex pistols danelectro cm 1 cool cat metal   make sure you get the cool cat metal  not the metal ii   that s a fine pedal as well  but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal   the cool cat metal  or cm 1  is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals   basically  its a pre amp that sits on the floor   it has a fully adjustable eq with tons of volume and gain through the roof   so you can do anything from a clean boost  with the gain at minimum there is virtually no coloration to your tone  to high gain metal stuff  with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between   it works well with any amp i ve tried it on  and you can find tons of great sounds   its an unbelievably versatile pedal  and its even true bypass   the best part is  danelectro seems to have made way too many of them  so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30   a true hidden gem that s actually cheaper than a ds 1 joyo jf 03 crunch distortion   this little guy surprised me   its supposedly a clone of the mi audio crunch box  and  if so  that must be one awesome pedal too   its essentially a marshall stack in a box  and boy does it ever succeed at that   great crunch  tons of volume and gain  it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin  stack   it even sounded good going into my modeling amp  very few pedals work well with my modeling amp  and this one even sounded better than the marshall simualtion built in   and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped  fantastic speaking of joyo  i ve had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from moen  another chinese pedal maker  and i m honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag  especially themoen mo fm fuzz moowhich honestly out big muffs every big muff i ve ever played through    so joyo and moen  they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz  od  and dirt pedals  check them out  and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a chinese company  please keep in mind that none of the pedals listed in my review  ds 1 included  are made in america  let alone the western hemisphere  hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for   also  if you can t actually try a pedal out at the store  youtube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do i should also mention that if you try and love the ds 1 and it suits your needs  than more power to you   tone is subjective  every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps  and just because i may share different opinions on something that you love  that s okay   my main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information   you have plenty of options for distortion pedals  the ds 1 is not the only thing out there that s affordable   find something you truly love and buy that   if its the ds 1  one of the pedals i ve mentioned here  or anything else  the important part is that it sounds right to you 
if you want your guitar to sound like eddie van halen  joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound  then get a boss gt 10  guitar multi effects processor  and install boss gt 10 patches by james limborg  search google for boss gt 10 patches by james limborg 
i was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product  a work around for the main issue follows the review  the flaws that bother me in order of significance are 1  quality  very weak soft metal screws  using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw heads on all 4 that i worked with  2 of them rounded out so much that i was afraid they would be hard to remove later  causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws 2  engineering   the instructions recommend  and the screws  the ones that come with the straplocks  are designed for a #2 phillips screwdriver  however  a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap buttons  so you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit  or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job 3  engineering   the point of connection for the strap is 5 8th of an inch out from the guitar  the strap button has a radius about 3 16ths of an inch  therefore any lateral stress  i e  weight of the guitar  is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw  a 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it  half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course   get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher realistically  if the screws weren t total crap  this might have been a 3 or 4 star review  once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won t fit and get the things properly installed  it would probably work out for most people  so if you are stuck with a set  here s what i recommend go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1" oval head stainless steel replacement screws  note that these won t fit properly  but they are the closest match and can be modified   they are 21 cents each at my local stores  and would have cost dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this  put the screw into an electric drill  pointy end in  so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill  run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head  it doesn t need much  i used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each  while you are at it  file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button install with the new screws as normal  and recommend that your friends try a different brand 
sorry  i don t like these as they re just too big  they stand out too much  they do work and they re effective but they are too pronounced  there are many good alternatives  strap gaskets  strap locks  undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap   again  they work  but they re not aesthetic nor elegant  i also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like i should be wearing big purple platforms when i play  not cool 
the thing is that they don t seem to stay  i mean  you can change the position of the pop filter by varying the shape of the metallic &#34 arm&#34   but it doesn t stay where you put it  and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality  but  i think if you re lucky if just might get the job done 
i ordered this product to use for personal recording  and thought   what could possibly go wrong  i ordered it "new " and it definitely shows signs that it not new  first  the package was stapled  that s right  stapled together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened  then  to make matters worse  there is a hole in one side of the fabric  when i order something new  i expect it to be new  based on this product alone  i would not recommend buying from this seller 
well  what can i say  based on the customer reviews  this purchase seemed like a no brainer  however  after only 4 months of light use  used on my rig at home  it is toast  the cable barely holds a signal now  constantly need to jiggle the thing to work   and before you ask  &#34 is it perhaps your output jack &#34   all of my other cables work with my gee tar  so it is definitely the cable   anyway  i gave it 2 stars because while it was working it sounded great through my roland jc120 
as the title states  this is a lightly padded duffle bag  nothing more  if you re toating between practice with an instructor  it s okay  i purchased it for that reason   and i m an adult  so i can be careful  this bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage  i would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag  it will prevent my guitar from scuffs  dings  dent & dirt  but that s it there are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason i gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price 
i bought the wrong gauge  i read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong  i bought the  90 gauge at guitar center and love them  these were made for that dave mustain muted crunch sound  i don t know if i will use these forever but for right now i love them  just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do dunlop ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new buy em    
i ve been playing guitar for over 40 years  and these tortex picks are nearly the worst i v ever used   they are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackity clack noise   dunlop ultex picks sound much better 
i can t hear the sounds of the strings over the flick of these flimsy picks across them  better for electric guitar but still hard to play fast
i recently bought a few packs of jazz iiis and i was shocked   they don t play at all like what i was expecting   under high magnification the edge doesn t look the same as the old jazz iii either  and they don t play the same if you turn them over     what s up with that i m sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like dunlop   let s hope this is just a short term fluke 
it s simple  basic  but i don t think it does that good of a job  this is because it doesn t really humidify that much and doesn t extend very far into the guitar 
not a great mic  but if you need something realitively cheap  it ll do   limited dynamic range   but  it works   wish i d have gotten something a little nicer though 
this is a basic eq pedal  that is a bit noisy in my testing  even when running on battery power  there is a bit of hiss that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs 
i don t like the feel or sound of these strings   i bought both the  010 and the  011 and they both hurt my fingers and sound like tin foil   i would not buy these again
it is not the size for mini guitar  may be for the big one   connections are shaky  you will surely notice that the quality is toooo low 
not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder   thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus     but  not quiet up to par   you ll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips 
the wire clipper and winder work o k   but the pin puller is badly designed and doesn t slip under the ball of the pin in order to lift it out  bad design by someone who doesn t use it to pull pins out of a bridge  i end up using a jim dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out  i ve done it successfully for years 
header says it all  works well enough as a string winder  but i was really lookin for something to pull my bridge pins with and for me  this did not work well at all  went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle 
i honestly really didn t find this thing useful at all  first  the wire clipper side is relatively bulky  no flush cutting  and doesn t open easily  very stiff action   so trying to get the clipper onto the wire with the very small opening and at the same time peering over the tool itself as it blocks the view   ick  and as for the winder    i suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding  it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner  but it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything i used it on  so no nice &#34 tight&#34  fit  more of a &#34 jiggle&#34  fit  plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table doesn t help  didn t even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing  just looked at it    guess that notch in the peg winder is it each time i have set out to use it  i end up turning my pegs manually and grimacing over the stiff action of the wire cutters while to align it on the string  i just recently ended up buying a set of crescent brand miniature cutters & needle nose pliers set the pliers are just the thing for pulling the strings and keeping tension while winding   when i have to redo my mothers acoustic guitar  i ll try the notch bridge peg puller  but other wise  this thing gets a serious two star &#34 meh&#34  
i purchased elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store   put them on my eko ranger xii acoustic 12 string   have 2 problems with the strings   first  the bass e  11th string  broke while tuning it up   had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string  not elixir    i have changed strings many  many times  so i am convinced it was not my stringing  but a weakness in the e string itself   second  the high d  8th string  seems "dead"  it does not "ring" as it should and as the other high strings do  though none as much as other 12 string sets i ve used    considering these strings cost much more than others  i certainly am disappointed in them   hardly matters if they last longer if they don t sound as good 
not two weeks after i put these on the a string broke close to the ball on the string   i break high e strings on occasion   but something as thick as an a string   maybe it was a defective string as i thankfully bought two sets and i was able to pull the a out of the other set and it has been fine since   now however i have the dilemma of should i just buy more strings and just use the second set as i need them   further more do i stick with the same brand   that is supposed to last longer than average strings   at this point i am going to keep playing this set until its time to change then go from there   i will update once i decide if i should stick with this brand or go back to super slinky supdate 3 25well another month went by a week ago  and the d string broke in the same fashion leaving me to believe i either got defective strings are these strings are not as good as they are said to be  either way its losing another star   if it happens with a different set of strings i will reevaluate my guitar review and change accordingly
i bought these strings after buying some elixir strings for my acoustic  which i was pretty happy with   for my strat  however  these strings did not sound right from the start  after about a week i really started wondering if it was just in my head or if i really didn t have sustain that i thought i usually got from a new pair of strings   i convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems  and i was right   i put a pair of d addario xl 9 5  highly recommended for those players who can t decide between 9s or 10s  and was amazed at how much tone and sustain i was losing with these elixir strings   i did feel like i could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings  but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently   don t let the higher price on these strings entice you  go with a good set of d addario or ernie ball strings for consistent long lasting strings 
looked like the chrome was cheesey and they ended up breaking but they worked while they were used in a guitar with the proper pinhole next to the screw position
did not hold the strings down very well for me    i love the feel of it  but the spring needs more power 
i recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars  one was in the skb fender case  $99 95 on amazon   the other in this gator case purchased locally   i was told it was just as good as the fender case  both ended up in checked luggage   after 1 flight from florida to lax and back  non stop  minimal handling  the glue on the top section gave up   the padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case   neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape  but after having the padding fall out  i just ordered another skb fender case   the gator will be re glued and used only for local trips   the skb fenders will be my airline cases from now on 
i don t know who designed the leg feature of this thing  but they need to go back to engineering school  when you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position  they re quite difficult to pop open  and once opened into place  you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off  because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand it d truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place  and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar  i just don t like the features of this stand at all 
not happy with the sellers description or the product  the description says "heavy duty" which makes you assume that it s a regular hard plastic mic clip  but it s not  it s rubber    it sucks  used it a couple times and it s hard to slide the mic in and i can see after a couple more uses how it s probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly  and flex  it s flexible    who uses flexible mic clips     make sure you don t buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead 
not so pleased with the sound quality  sorta disappointed with it over all   but ya get what ya pay for     so i ll keep it anyway
i ve purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store  mainly due to the low cost  they work okay  but are difficult to keep in tune  the guitars have to be re tuned often when temperature  humidity  or playing more than ten minutes occurs  my biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion  add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string  then the strings go "flat" sounding  these are not quality strings at all  just cheap chinese made quality  they are okay for someone that doesn t play often  but if you play daily or as a performer  avoid these strings  better strings are worth the extra cost  you actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings  i ve had this problem with all the d addario brand strings  both for electric or acoustic  6 or 12 string guitars  the thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing  the tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time  cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster 
i have played on d addario before   actually the first string i started out on super light s are ok   but can wear out real fast   so  it s importent not to put to much stess on  them     espescially if you do alot of tricks  pinched hormonic s vibrato s  extreme bend s   etc  they will break   any skilled guitarist know s  to use  extream  caution when tuning    any strings i did try extra light  while they do soud nice and have a nice feel to them   i would not recamend these for beginer s   cause beginer s tend to press hard  when they first stat out personally   i don t like d addario s at all   i find the tone to bright 
far too slippery for my fingers when i shredding and the tip wears out way too fast as well 
my picks fall out way too easy while i m playing live
this was bought based on the advice of others  i had a cable with the standard neutrik switchcraft type ends fail on me  and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage it worked great for about 4 6 months  and then broke  it happened so quickly  the trad types seem to take longer  that i swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar  after confirming the guitar was okay  i tried a shorter cable  which worked fine d addario does offer lifetime replacement  but it puts you in a bit of a bind   you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement  and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable out of pocket  you also have to get r a  taken altogether  this makes it a deal breaker  the extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years  in my case  i bit the bullet and did what i should have done the first go round and got a really nice dimarzio cable again  this cable sounds good while it works   capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue  the good news is that imo high price is not a guarantee of any cable sounding good  the replacement dimarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons  i don t get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable  but i want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range  this one meets half of those criteria  but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later  well  expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan so the replacement that planet waves sent me is now the backup  and is still in the original packaging  i figure i ll use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable  so it should last a long time in that situation  if i have a few $ for the shipping and d addario is still honoring the lifetime warranty if when the 2nd one breaks  i may get it replaced  more likely i will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it  even $4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable   imo it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement if this cable would have last 1 5 to 2 years  i d probably give it 5 stars given the price  and if d addario took away the warranty thing  it would probably re shape the customer s perception on what something at this price should cost  because it s a wear item  plain and simple  idk how much r&d  it s worth their trouble to put in something at this price point  but that s is what i would shoot for   a realistically acceptable period of trouble free use w no warranty as the trade off  that would not make it a deal breaker 
these look so neat that my brother and i both unknowingly ordered these for each other as gifts last christmas  unfortunately they feel too chunky to use and the colored tip grips the strings in an unfortunate way making it difficult to play 
nice looking gooseneck  threads are clean  fits well   however  the gooseneck is too flexible and will not hold up a mic  shure sm58  without collapsing   better try another brand  or spend a buck or two more to get a better product 
i bought these mics to fit a shure mic and a gls mic and it doesn t fit either   a little too small 
not very substantial  it began to tear on my guitar strings  i was hoping for something that would hold up to more uses 
this pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like crazy  you will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit i m not too fond of the sound quality of the reverb either  there are a lot of better sounding units out there but some folks might find it acceptable over all i would not recommend this product 
compression sustain wise  this unit is decent but i cannot abide the noise     i tolerated it for a while but wound up pulling it for a cleaner compressor    
if you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in a guitar > volume pedal > amp configuration  inserting effects pedals anywhere you like   this is a poorly engineered pedal   it can t be "true bypass" as long as the signal travels through a potentiometer but they can use pots that are a virtual short when adjusted properly and with the pedal forward anyway  the difference between plugging my guitar directly into the amp and placing this pedal in the chain between the amp is immediately noticeable   the tone becomes duller  the output drops   i would expect that from an asian knock off  not from an a list gear maker   i might be over stating ernie ball s reputation  though they make some fine guitars i gotta say  and i ve used their strings for many years if you plan to use this eb 6180 pedal with digital effects you should be fine   this is because the digital device will take two measurements of pure resistance at either end of the rocker   the signal processing takes place in the unit  not the pedal    those units have their own tone problems but that s another review  it does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer  not "true bypass" in other words  may fix this problem  which is more than likely related to impedance  like a tuner pedal  between the guitar and the volume pedal   i will need to try that out  but it does not excuse ernie ball from their responsibility   major fail on their part 2 stars is generous because eb fails to honor the simple "first do no harm" principle  it harms your tone   how dumb is that   the pedal itself is very attractive  appears indestructible  though i have my doubts about their "string" mechanism over time   the rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor i have no recommendations for a volume pedal   because of the feel  and esthetics  i do plan to keep this for the digital device use  but wish it was able to do what it promises  and fails so miserably  to deliver 
i started by powering 1 stomp box on this chain and it worked  but when i tried to add a second third stomp box  i couldn t get any guitar sound only a loud buzz  i returned this product i did further testing  i would not recommend it to anyone  with my personal experience in mind  i would advise you to save your money and get a pedalboard power supply  hope this helps
through my ampeg bass amp  the low e string gets distorted when you push the bass control above 7  and the upper 3 strings sound kind of plain 
my guitar originally came with d addrio exp and they sounded good  i replaced them with elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good  but the finish was wearing fast  this time i got a 3 pack of ej16 3d light  the were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly but the sound is the problem  it s terrible  they sound very muddy  crisp tone distinction is just not there  i thought light would be the better route  but now i m not sure  i purchased some others to try  also  since a purchased a 3 pack  i may just change the strings completely again to see if i just have some dead strings 
bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand  mediums too hard on my thin fingers and will stick to light and extra light gauges  the strings were hard to slide  un slippery  and changing barr chords made so much squeaks i didn t like  tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes  g string snapped 2 days later at the windings with the string wounds pried right off  \
d addario what s up  these didn t last long at all i don t play my martin very often  too busy with electrics    but these were trashed in a month guess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now  never purchase again 
this is a beautiful shock mount  however for the price it didnt perform  the mount doesnt fit directly to the blue yeti and it leaks wind and plosive sounds on p s and s s  not worth the price 
i was not happy with the sound of these strings  the ead steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon gbe strings sound tinny  for an extra $2 i bought the d addario ej45 pro arte and got a much  much higher quality sound out of my 40 yr old yamaha g 60   spend the extra $2 its well worth it 
i tried the dean markley blue steel light accoustic strings on my takamine guitar  and will soon replace them   on quality control  the high e steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it  two of which show after stringing the guitar   string did not break as i rather expected  but it looks bad   on sound  these seemed okay at first  but i still find it hard to keep in tune after a week  especially the high b and e steel strings  which just don t sound that good to me   and i find the low e wound string notes tend to be too high as i move up the neck  more so than other sets i have used guess i ll go back to d addario and ernie ball 
if you expect to get what you pay for  prepare to be disappointed  sounds weak  sounds old  sounds worn  sounds dull  i wanted to experience a new brand on my stratocaster  i can afford to pay twice as much  but i am going to keep using my d adario strings from now on  i am so disappointed  these strings are for the &#34 campfire guitarist&#34  not the aggressive picking thrilling  tapping  pull offs  or sweepers  if you are a tone fanatic keep looking  if your guitar deserves the best  do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings  respect your guitar   i wouldn t be surprised if they are made from china 
i bought one of these in the beginning   just to have something   as this is better than having nothing at all   but it s certainly nothing special  the material and the skinny width was uncomfortable for me and exacerbated my neck pain  so i only used it for a very short time on the other hand  if you have a nice guitar that you really take great care of  then you ll probably want to invest in a much nicer strap at some point  i upgraded to a really nice 3&#34  wide black leather levy s guitar strap   which is five stars all the way if you re a newbie and don t have a strap  and are on a tight budget and need something  then this planet waves strap will probably work for you   till you can upgrade to something nicer and more comfortable to wear  just my 2 cents 
i have a taylor 710ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar  rather than ruin the finish of the guitar i just got a different strap  plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since i had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where i liked it to play  if the nylon is not a problem for you and the ends fit over your guitar this strap is very well made 
good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice this was my first guitar strap i had ever bought  i didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by  over the 6 months ive had it i took it off my electric guitar and put it on a new electric acoustic i recently got and it keeps popping off  this is a problem is standing up playing at a gig or just around your house  the guitar could take that head dive of death  while one dive might not do too much damage a few might crack the neck or worse my advice  unless you plan to sit and play  which you wont really need a strap anyways  the whole time  spend alittle more to get a leather strap  spending more on a leather strap will help avoid hole stretching and the popping off of the strap in mid play 
all i gotta say about  this product is that i get a volume tone loss when it s plugged  that is a very big problem for me  other than that is very well built  but the fact that it decreases my volume is a major issue for me 
the travel would be tolerable for a sitting position     but i stand in front of a mic on stage   the pedal generates  a lot of &#34 noise&#34  so i can t use it   you get what you pay for   king vox and dunlop high gain  both passive  have passed the test  and i m pretty picky 
i ordered two of them and both arrived within a week  i tested both of them  they sound quite good as the majority reviewers said  that s why i bought this       and they are solidly built too  not one of the pretty light microphone that comes in with cheap karaoke machine i don t expect to come with it  so no cable is ok for me here is the but          there is no on off switch  this really pissed me off but this is my fault  i should have read the 1 star review first the photo shows no on off switch  however this does not catch any attention and all seller seems to have trouble to say "this product does not have this  does not have that   " it only says what the product does have oh well  i got stuck with two microphones without on off switch i can buy an adapter with on off switch for microphone 
i was a little disappointed   don t know if it s a qc problem or if i just got some rejects but out of 6 pots  1 was out of spec  315k  and 2 were almost out  289k  205k    1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10%   they are ctl s so i m a bit confused   other than that they work fine  they have the nut  washer and cap included  no knob    i will be upgrading the caps 
i would think it would be reasonable to assume that this would fit a squier bullet strat  but the holes didn t line up  it didn t fit between the neck and the bridge  in fact  it was completely wrong  nice quality though 
buttons itself are fine  however when i was installing it the screw broke inside the guitar  right above the thread   and i even pre drill it  there is no way i can get it out    so had to find real screw and drill new hole next to it  now slightly off center now 
i ve ordered two of these kits in the aged white  and each one has had severe scratches and scuffs all over the tremolo cavity cover plate  literally to the point where it looks like someone dropped them on a concrete floor  accidentally stepped on them  and then decided they were good enough to send out for sale  the knobs  covers and tips are all in great shape  however 
my first desk mic stand  and the adjuster part broke after only two days of use  it worked once when i originally set it  then kaput  it s never worked properly since  i still use it but have to wrap electrical tape so that it s at the right height  i would not purchase this product again 
i purchased these picks  because i play bass in an alternate punk metal band  we play drop tuning and playing with a plastic or nylon pick creates alot of noise  i was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise  they don t make that annoying plastic to metal sound  but they are very flexible  i need to have alot of pick speed  these slow me down way to much  the other reviews i read stated that these were like rigid picks  but no they are not  too bad as i had high hopes good picks if you don t have to tremolo pick  not very good if do have to 
i should have read the reviews carefully   it s definitely something different  but not sturdy at all  rubber bits come off as you strum  and there are complaints of skid marks on strings and fingers  ouch  i m much happier with my friday the 13th glow in the dark picks   that is an experiment that worked and who cares about hard pick sounds anyway  if you want something that sounds like your fingers strumming  why don t you use&#8230  your fingers 
i tried it for ipad  it kinda wobbles up and down  it has a light strip of metal without a bracing design so it flaps up and down when something heavy is attached to the end such as my ipad   i only recommend it for something light weight   there s better ones out there  see my review on the music stand  that comes with a solid extension arm   
i thought i could take the smell  i couldn t otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding the case is nice too  but everything smells like the chinese rubber smell at harbor freight tools   sulfur  i tried airing it out for a week with no success if you have no sense of smell  get one 
the material it s made of is good  and it holds the guitar  the only things i don t like are 2 1 each of the corners has a cap  the one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off 2 the part at the bottom that looks like a u  used to hold the guitar  it spins    it means that there is nothing like a bolt or a screw to make it stay still  so every time you try to put your guitar on you have to make sure to put that straight i would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one 
it s semi secure on carpeting or hard floor  but all together i am pretty unsatisfied with this stand  the bottom piece has no way to lock in place  and although with the guitar on it it is more stable  i am not comfortable enough risking my wonderful guitar to something rather flimsy   i prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall  this one  meh  not worth the purchase in my opinion    booooooooo 
purchased these for a new heritage h 575 arch top   a few months later  the high e string unwound from the ball end   overall good strings  good sound    this set simply didn t last very long   i will replace with 12s however   for me the 11s felt a little loose   the 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box   i have 12s on an epiphone joe pass model   i ll be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s 
the version i picked came with a grounding wire  claiming that using the wire in conjunction with the brush would discharge all of the electrostatic producing snap  crackles  and pops   if you believe that  continue to do so  and maybe you ll imagine less surface noise than was the case before employing the device   speaking more pragmatically  i ve found some use for the item only when loose  conspicuous debris has collected on the surface of a vinyl disc 
i purchased these as well as the jim dunlop 7000 locks   i recommend the 7000 model   they both work the same way and are made pretty much the same way  but these are just to big and clumsy   the 7000 model does the same and doesn t take as much space   you will need the straps to either be thin at the ends or your strap buttons pegs to have enough room for the strap and then these units   this is true for either one of the models   i have a regular nylon 2&#34  levy strap and these two models  7000 and 7007si  work well  but i prefer the smaller  rounder model  7000  
i bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what i found is that although it looks cool  it s complicated  which for a capo is saying something   the release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use bottom line  if you don t mind the extra effort and don t plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using  then maybe you will enjoy it  for everyone else  look elsewhere 
barring any interference from any other devices or radio stations broadcasting on the same frequency and any manufacturer s defects     the unit does what it was meant to do  i do however question whether the word "pro" should apply to this system  although the 1 4 inch mono plug that comes with the receiver offers the ability of plugging directly into most powered speaker systems or to a mixer  the overall quality of the audio brought back memories of mornings standing outside the classroom with my schoolmates and listening first to the national anthem being played and then announcements coming out of the pa system  the signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about  to its defense  it is fighting against a radio music station broadcasting at near band frequency which can be received if the transmitter is off or further than 25 feet away after playing with the device for a couple more minutes  i noticed that any movement whether i kept the receiver and transmitter stationary and i moved about my home or moved just the transmitter about severely affected the quality of the reception  even the length of the mic cord  whether wound up or straight or even just gathered around the sending unit had an adverse effect on the sound output quality  yikes    perhaps its because of the competing signal its receiving from another source which i previously described above  i m afraid this would not be a very usable and dependable device for my purposes  i ll probably be returning this unit asap 
i got these for a custom les paul 5 string bass i had built and one of the locks broke off after a month and a couple of uses  also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use  i had never used strap locks before and don t think i will again 
no where on the description does it say that the mic clip is not included   the only place is on the box after you have received the item   there s no instruction  which is fine   but in the product description it doesn t say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you can t use it i bought this and have it shipped second day because i need to use it and now i can t because it doesn t come with a mic clip which i have to spend another 5 10 to get it plus shipping   the price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip   but without it  i felt cheated 
the only reason i m not giving this one star is that i didn t expect much for such a low cost pedal  i got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals  we have a punk ska band  think suicide machines  sublime  and need to switch a lot in all our songs  i thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile  nope  this pedal sucks your guitar s tone  and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going  and its not a pleasant sound either way  avoid 
i purchased this as my first guitar slide  i loved it for about one month  then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces  i almost cut myself  i will never buy a glass slide again  i recently bought a dunlop brass slide and love it  the difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier  mellow tone  and glass is crisper  louder  and does not break  i would not suggest this to anyone  the metal ones are about the same price  they don t break  and sound way better  there s a reason all pros use metal  the review below is wrong  slides are meant to cover your entire finger  all the way to the tip  you don t bend your finger to play slide  you retune your guitar to an open tuning  just thought i would point that out 
this is my first guitar belt  it is not a good fit  the connection to the guitar is far too thick  i try to not remove it too often as it is highly inconvenient and hard to manage   other than that it is usable  sort of  but i am thinking of getting some kind of metal hook instead  the thick leather is so unpleasant to deal with 
i have other harmonica s but thought i d like a set of blues harps   i thought that if it s made by hohner  it must be fairly good   wow  was i wrong   too hard to push notes through them   i wouldn t recommend these to anyone 
dampit was recommended to me by a guitar instructor years ago  and i have used the standard model for some time  it seemed kind of tricky to get it to hold enough water to humidify the guitar yet still get it dry enough to have absolutely zero drips inside the instrument i used to hang it by the clip and let it drip dry for about 15 minutes while i was doing other things before placing it in the guitar later i wound up trying the humidipak humidifiers and to help recharge them on a dreadnought  i took to putting the dampit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a resealable top  pressing on the sides to saturate it  then rolling it up in a planet waves microfiber polishing cloth and pressing on the end of the cloth to soak it  then unroll the cloth  put the dampit in under the headstock where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell case  then rolling up the end of the polishing cloth to cover the wet end with dry material and pushing it into the sound hole over the humidipaks  worked great so i ordered a super dampit for my new 000 acoustic planning to do the same  they now ship without the clips  company says they ve had too many complaints about scratches  though i didn t seem to have a problem  wasn t about to take a chance with a costly new acquisition  more importantly  there is supposed to be a sponge to absorb water inside the tube and when i pressed on the sides of the tube  it was empty  so i sent it back to amazon for a refund  no problem getting the refund  but i m moving on from dampit to try the planet waves insert with a sponge that has eliminated the chance of water dripping in the guitar or damaging the finish if you use it to soak the polishing cloth as described above  that still works great  but there s really not enough room for that in the om model  so between that and the missing sponge  will just try something else 
the only instrument this works well on is my yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings  for steel strings i want more pressure  i advise getting the ns capo that is not "lite"   i prefer that one above this model 
i ordered one of these because i like my other planet waves capo a lot  i believe its the older metal version of this  not the &#34 lite&#34    however  this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings  especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner  on a martin jumbo acoustic   it will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing  your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too i m not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one  it doesn t seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as i can tell  unless i just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw  i wouldn t recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck my recommendation is the classic kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove  it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use   if you are looking for the screw down style  i would look for the older version of this and avoid the &#34 lite&#34  
it is inexpensive but is difficult to use  anywhere with other noise  i used it for several years but it is only a backup now   nice part is that you can calibrate the tuning  although probably would not be used by most musicians   other than that i think money would be better spent on a headstock type tuner   i would not recommend it 
the chorus is subtle    but it seems lacking to me  it is subtle but really weak compared to the classic rich ibanez chorus i have 
this system works just okay   try to turn it up and you get bad feedback my microphone stopped working shortly after i purchased this item   i contacted pyle to see about a replacement and got nothing but runaround from them they couldn t give me a price for repair or to purchase a new one  or where i could even buy a replacement very frustrating 
in the old days  we used tobe able to buyall 6 nylon clear strings    now tis almost impossible    with these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetar    one will prefer playing on the hi 3 treble strings   very nice  resonant  and clean   not shrillbutwhat is that garbage metallica with the other 3 supposed to bebass strings i dont know   again  like someone else noted the obvious>>>>>sound transition from the nylon to the wire wound nylon is gigantic this makes the move from the d to the g string too noticablecant they even make  6 strings that sound similar for the same one guitar even  makes it sound like 2 different geeetars totally   sucks bad now oohthanks man
don t know what i expected for such a cheap price  but this product s quality is in line with its price  also  the fit over my ukulele s fretboard is very tight  making it hard to put on and remove 
this one is probably closer to a $150 guitar  the fit and finish is quite nice but at the end of the day it s just like most of the other made in china guitar  from the reviews i was really hoping this was some great gem for only $200  but i m not at all impressed  one thing that bothered me is that these guys make everything from guitars to jet skis   which usually means they re a jack of all trades but a master of none i recently bought a johnson jg 610 n  a johnson jg 620 n  a bristol bd 16  a jasmine s35  and this yamaha  if i d only played the yamaha i d probably think it was a pretty nice guitar  but having tried all of these side by side i can definitely say it s not at all amazing  the bristol blows this thing out of the water  and not just because it s $50 cheaper  it plays and sounds better  the johnson guitars both have a little higher action  not a lot of highs  and a cheaper fit and finish  the jasmine is nice but i haven t spent enough time playing it to give a true review the yamaha fg700gs is definitely neat to look at  and has decent mids  but doesn t really have a great high to low end punch  now  it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body  but  the sound range overall wasn t great  the bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison  also  the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the yahama  though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the same can t help but think that the reviews here are a bit "hive mind" where everybody buys into a hype  maybe i got a dud guitar  but i doubt it  they re all made in the same factory 
i bought this to connect a technics tt with an audio technica cartridge to my newer onkyo receiver with no phono input  the unit did work but i had to turn the volume to 80  out of 100  to get any reasonable volume  in addition i have an onkyo m3040 connected to the receiver that i use for as a zone 2 amplifier  with this preamp i am getting some serious spikes into the amp  they are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone 2 speakers would drop  i do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preamp this unit may work perfectly fine with a behringer mixer but for my use it doesn t meet my needs at all  i am returning it 
the mixer is good for the price but i had to return my first one soon after opening it due to some loose parts moving around inside  the packing way below average  as a matter of fact  it was the only outer box without any cushioning  after seeing those ups and fedex delivery videos i would not pack a ups or fedex shipping item in such a poor packing  however  the great seller   i am referring to amazon  immediately responded and sent me a replacement along with a prepaid label to return the fist unit  second unit too had the similar packing but no damages  worked fine 
considering the price is so cheap on these  i took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio  to say that i used it "rarely" is an understatement   maybe once a month when i have friends over for jamming as a way to get my vdrums and a bass di through my powered wedges  that said  within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether  and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume all the way up aside from it not working less than a year later  as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well  however  if you re building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice  it s a decent little mixer while it works pass on this   sound quality is decent for the price  but reliability gets a zero 
i d give this 1 and a half stars if i could  this little amp is so noisy if you hardly touch move a cable plugged into it  it is so hard to get full sound in head earphones with this  i can only hear in one ear in every headphone output  and hardly anything in the other  i have to always adjust my cable s connector to get any full sound for a second  i can still use this  but hardly  i really don t like this 
if you go very high with the boost in frequencies  you will get noise in significant quantities  too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation  pay the extra money and get something quiet  others complained about this and they were right  if you want to experiment with equalization  its good and cheap  some complained about each band boosting others  this is more of a user problem than manufacturing  if you want to isolate a frequency range  boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and you ll get a narrow range  in this respect  its like an mxr 6 band 
soi f you want to turn distor t off u cannot dig it s always on   alwaysif you like hard rock that wayu need this tiny gig thingie
while the product came as described  the build quality felt a little lacking  on the website it mentioned that it accepts the shure ksm32 threading but it does not  so if you re threading matches the ksm32  look elsewhere 
i picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store   who doesn t need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag  right   the price was less than ten bucks  but unfortunately it doesn t work very well   the microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate   it gets you in the ballpark  but just barely   strike a note once  and it s sharp   play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune   i think the korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better 
strings rust very easily  yield fairly poor tone and break often  though they have the same bending ability as  09  42 
pros  price point good  clean audio quality when working  changeable mesh ballscons  limited upper frequency response  &#62 8khz  one stopped working after about half an hour of use  it was not dropped or abused in any way  requires nearly direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver for any distance greater than 10 feet 
summaryacoustic sounds &#34 ok&#34   but noisy in weird ways  i returned it  price seems high for what it is and vs  alternatives in the marketplace pros  boss case is metal  mechanical design is durable  standard 9v power  and the power jack is on the back where it belongs   variety of acoustic sounds possible   personally  i only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all though cons  fizzy noise integrated with notes played  or chords   generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain  while i have several boss pedals  i think they always make the knobs too small and the font print too small  i prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing details the basic concept is good  i had an ac 2  prior model  and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note  it wasn t in between the notes or when not playing  it was integrated with the sound of every note you played  or chord  and you could not filter it  it was also just noisy in the pedal chain  adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some  however  i sold that model because i didn t want the pedal in the chain with everything else and i wasn t happy with the sound  at the time  the ac 2 s were selling for about $85 new  boss since redesigned and raised the price significantly on the ac 3 i bought the ac 3 hoping they had improved the issues of the ac 2    and they did  a little  but not enough to keep it  i returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues  just not as pronounced  i think the ac 3 could work for gigging  but there are other choices that sound as good for $25 instead of $130 to $150  with tax and or shipping  so to me  the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great i opted for a behringer acoustic modeller instead  they make two    a &#34 300&#34  and a &#34 400&#34   the 400 has reverb on the pedal  i opted for the 300 and got it for $25  i expect the durability will be lower on the behringer than the boss as it has a plastic case  however  this is an effect i pull out just once in a while and since i can buy 4 or 5 or 6 behringers for the price of a boss    if it breaks   i ll just buy another i also have a boss gt 100 multi effects unit  you can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that  out of the behringer or out of the boss ac 3  the least cost effective of those choices is the ac 3   and it has noise issues the other two don t have i m not saying its a bad pedal  i m just saying it wasn t the best choice for me when considering the cost  the sounds  and my usage model  if they would fix the noise issues  i might have even kept it  i did opt to keep the behringer for those times i m using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect  this boss pedal just didn t work that well for me 
when i purchased this i d seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar  guess what  as far as i can tell  there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with  this is not worth the money 
disapointed  the sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound  it sound muffled  i will have to replace it soon 
  it works but expect some flaws first finding a driver to use was a pain it doesn t come with a software disc so look on behringer s support site for driver download whatever driver you do use it kills all other audio you can t run any other media player and get sound my advice is unless you have a dedicated pc or laptop for using this   get something else 
in fact  i don t think this hosa gtr215r cord lasted 2 hours  one step on the cord and it came apart  this purchase is the very reason why i m looking to buy a wireless system  maybe if you re using this to run a pa i would recommend it  but if any performer is hard on their cords i wouldn t recommend this item    but to be fair  i would recommend wireless to any performer  you ll end up saving money over the long haul 
the good this is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones the bad the tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination  unless you like hyper distorted noise   the cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied   the effects are hit and miss as well   plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it s downright offensive throw in the fact it chews through batteries  the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use  and how it loses its small and portable factor with a guitar cable  headphone cable  and power adapter plugged into it  i d be hard pressed to recommend this product unless you really need to practice through headphones 
it s a good ideal but the big problem i have is if ya are using a tube amp    have a 65  twin reverb fender tube   ya get one hell of a hum  it s so bad i just can t use it at all  i m not sure about a transistor amp  but who uses those     
i heard great things about the s6 and so  being a novice without any idea of what to buy  i bought it based upon reviews  i ve played it for a year  and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars  here are my  humble  thoughts   the seagull is comparatively unattractive  its snake head headstock with the tiny  not great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar   the cedar top is very nice looking  and the rosewood fretboard bridge on mine are very nice   the laminate sides back seem much thicker than competing guitars  and this makes the guitar heavier and  to me  less &#34 alive&#34  resonant during playing   the satin finished cedar top is very easy to marr   the cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force  but at a heavy strum  the top seems to bottom out and lose definition   the treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy   the frets are smaller than competitors but are ok   the binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing   something i ve not encountered before   i can get the action very  very low before the frets rattle   nice all in all  it is an ok instrument that stands out simply because it s made in canada for asian mexican prices   that said  just because it comes from canada doesn t embody it with mystical vibes  in fact  for the price range  i can get a just as good asian mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back front  sitka spruce solid top wood  better tuners  and a more attractive headstock   with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good i don t regret getting it  but i feel like i overpaid for what i received  and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade s exchange rates  i have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price  seagull to me is over hyped thanks for reading 
in my experience these cables were not great   the connectors rattle  they are made of cheap materials and the cable subsequently had a ton of line noise   i can t expect miracles at that price point but i certainly expected better  i avoid this brand of cables 
i bought this unit for a friend  and i could compare with others overdrives i already have  i think the mxr badass custom modified overdrive or way huge green rhino are better choise 
i am a tone freak  i bought this pedal a while back under the impression that it would sound equal to a big muff  at the time i had never owned a big muff  i thought the sound it produced was big muff sound  i later took it to my friends house and matched settings with a real big muff  the difference was huge  the big muff sounded fuller where the little one sounded like you just took the sound and trapped it in a little box  i later bought a big muff and its been one of my go to pedals for at least three years of gigging  i am currently loving it still but i am curious about the nano big muff because i am looking to clear out space on my board but i will probably not use it if it sounds anything less than the real deal  i would only use the little big muff if my concerns for sound were out shined by the need to minimize board space
my hopes for this pad was that it would be soft a sqishy on my shoulder   the gel is pretty dense  so it s kind of hard and squishy and very heavy   i found that it just added more weight   i m not using it   i would look elswhere for a different product 
to heavy    it doesn t stay where you need it  slips down becuase of wieght   get something else or larger strap to dispers wieght of the guitar   
these cans were decent  back when they were just above 100 bucks  they ve inflated to 160 and that s just ridiculous  there is better in this price range  the srh840 s for example on ebay for 120~ bucks new  does everything better than these cans  the m50 s have really punchy bass  and extremely stringent highs  they re very loose in the low end  and their mids are recessed  that combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience  the pads are pleather and terribly uncomfortable  whilst having an almost starchy texture to them  the headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath  these phones are also terrible in regards to any soundstage at all  which means for gaming  these will be pretty terrible  they do some    some    new genres alright  but their extremely aggressive presentation makes these phones just hard to listen to  they also can t do lighter genres like jazz and classical due to their poor positoning  there are much much better monitors in this price range than these  the shure srh840 as i ve said before totally outclass these headphones in all areas stay away  don t fall victim to the noob hype 
if you can read the tiny little screen  this thing records nicely  but it s a pain in the axx to move from one selection to the other  there were a couple of times i almost threw against the wall  it has a tendency to completely freeze up and the on off switch does nothing  you have to pull the batteries out and reinstall them for the damn thing to work again 
i have finally learned my lesson i have purchased a number of these over the last year or two   and previously had the same opinion as reviewers that say "good for static applications" as the cable conductors are prone to breakage  even along the length of the cable  not just at the connectors   but they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok but now  after recently buying and installing a cable from a mic in a sound booth to a digital mixer i checked it out and it seemed to work a week later an acoustic duet came to record and the mic cable made the singer sound like she was singing behind a curtain   yup  the cable so by all means buy these on price  but when you get your items  please fully check them out   a simple "does it work yes no" is clearly not good enough  as i learned
levy s leathers could have made this guitar strap out of a softer material  especially on the edges   it cuts into your neck horribly  even thru a shirt  yukko   the fake leather on the ends are unbelievably cheap 
first behringer pedal i have returned  almost no effect provided by pedal  i have returned the unit  not worth it  lousy pedal 
i give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do  i give it a single star because it failed two weeks after the return period  generously  i ll give it 2stars  something like this really should last at least a year or more  cheap parts manufacturing   50 cents a day is not a good deal for a device of this nature 
sound is not so good  strange how the gain has to be turned up along with the volume to hear anything 
i used ac30 for years  lost them  and decided to make a change and buy these sound quality of ac30 wasn t anything to write home about but had decent cleans and gains  but this one has a horrendous clean  tried with my strat and tele  play jazz blues mostly   and mediocre gain  you can get a lot better sound even with the free amp programs for ipod and computers  buying a 25 35 buck connector cable   though  granted those tend to have feedback problems when you use certain gain y settings for people worried about construction  these turned out to be very sturdy  ac30s i previously used did  but the built materials are exactly same  even if you re determined to settle for the mediocrity of phone amps  go for cheaper models  or simply buy ac30  the latter has acceptable cleans  
as an amateur musician  i m always looking for ways to practice without chasing everyone out of the house with loud amplifiers and such   i thought this gadget would do the trick  but the quality of the sound and range of adjustment just didn t meet my expectations 
bought this years ago  it was a nice long cable that i bought figuring it d be durable but it didn t last  maybe it was my mistreatment of the cable but then again it should be built to gig    if i was better with wiring i m sure it s fixable but all in all it didn t last as long as i d hoped 
cable crackles when plug in jack is moved  gls brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison  both have tweed jackets however the hosa cable does not uncoil easily where the gls cable does  i would recommend the gls product over the hosa product 
the vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone  it now rest at bottom of a box 
on the plus side  these monitors look and feel amazing   they are coated in some kind of silky rubberized stuff and they are heavy and look neat they don t sound horrible   i mean  they are not computer speakers or anything   the sound is very forward  i would say harsh   that s not uncommon among studio monitors   there is definitely a lot of clarity here   not a ton of bass  but that s pretty much understood from monitors with woofers of this size   there s a few schools of thought on studio monitors   some people think they are basically for bringing out the warts in your music  others think they should sound more like a normal speaker   these will be more pleasing to people interested in the first   i definitely sounds like the music is right in your face when you are listening to this   any flaws would be quite noticeable i previously used krk rp8 s so i can compare these to them   granted  they are larger and more expensive  although they are also budget monitors   i liked them better than these   they were clear but also sounded nicer and  of course  had much more bass i was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in   see if i could improve the situation   but one of the speakers starts to buzz about 5 minutes after it s turned on   the buzz increases in volume over time   i tried moving them to a different location  turning the volume down  even disconnecting the audio feed  so they were only plugged into the power    nothing stopped the buzz   if they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again  the buzz starts up in more like 10 or 20 seconds   so i sent them back   i wasn t really impressed with the sound and i m definitely not satisfied with the quality control  so i m going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead   maybe behringer 3031a s or something   i think it s worth an extra 200 dollars or so to get a full sized monitor 
good grip  but too flexible  and the description says nothing the thickness or the flexibility of these picks  probably good for strumming  but not good for lead 
this is an affordable copy of the boss harmonist pedal  i bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature  but was surprised by how much fun the trem bar and flutter mode was to play with anyway on the third day the tracking on the pedal suddenly started to have about a one second delay  and on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem  hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise  also the pedal just started oscillating a few times  i would have given the behringer us600 five stars if it kept working  it tracked nice and didn t tone suck too bad 
some things are great values  others are cheap  the behringer is cheap  the clips are cheap  the clip that holds the 9v broke after the first change  the clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic  if you get stuck using batteries  plan on 3 4 hours worth of use  it s also a noisy pedal  like noisier than my dyna comp and od pedals combined  like you will not record with this pedal in your chain unless you want a mountain of noise  if you leave it plugged into your cables  even when powered down  it will eat your batteries all of those negatives aside  you are paying less than $40 for a reverb pedal that has several usable features  the 63  spring is great  the plate is also really good  it also has a worth the price alone "space" feature  also known as shimmer  a synth playing behind your instrument   paired with a chorus effect  you can get some really cool tones the rv600 is not without merit  but it is a bargain effect pedal and it has some fun to use features  if you gig or record and need a reverb   well   you aren t even looking at this pedal  if you play at home and have a low watt amp that doesn t have a reverb built in  this is a good option 
had i known what i was getting i would never have ordered it   there are gig bags and there are gig bags   i ve ordered and used inexpensive guitar gig bags   i expected more  this one offers almost no protection   the only reason i have not returned it yet is that the return shipping will leave little to refund  but may end up returning it anyway it  did  fit my kala ka tg with room to spare 
this seems to have been a rare case but still  i had my ukulele on is and it snapped  i m worried what might happen with a guitar or a bass
i purchased this stand for my electric guitar and used it for a couple of weeks before the weak weld broke on the neck holder at the top when i placed my guitar in it  upon close inspection  the weld was very poor and barely attached the neck holder to the upright tube  the tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe  025&#34  wall  so don t expect it to take much abuse before it snaps off  even if it is welded better than mine was  just folding the legs repeatedly back and forth will likely cause it to break or pop out one of light duty aluminum rivets on the legs  it is literally that thin of metal tubing for $10 11 i did not expect perfection  so to it s credit  it is foam covered where it needs to be and has never scratched my guitars this stand does have one other good quality  it is cheap  since it was less that $11  i cannot see going through the hassle of returning it  i was able to carefully weld mine back together  but this would probably not be an option for most  the stand might work fine if you don t fold it up regularly and if you leave it set up  but if you need portability and durability  i would definitely purchase a better quality stand 
when set on blink  they blink way too fast   when not set on blink  all 4 lights come on and focused into just 1 spot that the combined color come out white   useless design 
i purchased 4 of these  of the four 1 was no good on arrival another failed after 2 short time uses  i will not buy more  the first one was returned after some resistance from the seller the second one had passed the warranty time before it had failed  suggest thoroughly testing these upon arrival if you purchase these  for the $$$ should be more dependable 
just use a cloth or paper towel 
my issue with the pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply  i have a voodoo lab pedal power 2 plus the documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board  and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply  however  if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested  you re in for an unpleasant surprise first of all  regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board  the fitment to the power supply is there    sort of  there s no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together  i wasn t worried about this  since i doubt i ll ever chain them and only have access to 1 outlet the second issue is  the allegedly self tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter  once you ve got them in  or attempted to do so   they re never coming out  you ll probably have to break them  it s a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive the main issue i have with this board relating to my voodoo lab power supply is this  once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board  it can only go one place   you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don t fit the mounting location on this board  you can t plug them in because there s not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to i really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the voodoo lab power supply i own  but given that it doesn t fit like it s supposed to  i wish i could return this board   except i can t  because it now has holes drilled in it   you have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it  basically  i paid $100 for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro  needless to say  i m not very pleased 
from the product description  i expected something far more robust than this unit  by and large  i ve had great experiences with behringer pedals  but this reverb unit is the wimpiest i have ever used in 40 years of playing   no stronger than the reverb in a 5w first act amplifier 
this "would" be a great digital reverb but for the fact that the more you turn the level up on the reverb intensity  it simultaneously fades the initial attach of the strum  pluck or riff rendering the reverb relatively worthless if you  want a lot of reverb"  what the hell was behringer thinking   
the plastic knob that you use to tighten the ball and socket doesn t grip very well and even the lightest camera will slip and sag  it s a great idea but not well executed 
the plastic piece that screws the wire into the end was made of very thin plastic  and cracked in two within a week of light use  i guess i can redo it with electrical tape to make it work  but i have many whirlwind cables that have lasted me 15+ years  i expected more from this manufacturer  but i guess the quality is not the same as it used to be 
i bought this for a practice amp for my bass guitar  it showed up on amazon when i was doing a search for "bass guitar amps"  other regular guitar amps were not showing up so i was curious about it  after a bit of searching online to see if a guitar amp would work for practice situations  i thought i would give it a try because some people say yes  others said no  i wanted to test for myself  while i did get sound and was able to practice  it didn t have anywhere close to the tone i was hoping for  so i ended up returning it the next day  i m not upset about the amp itself  just that it shows up as a bass amp off the search  which is the only reason i gave it a shot  for a regular guitar  this would be fine but not bass  i which they would take bass out of the key words or whatever was in there to trigger this to show up  i was in the market for a practice amp for under $100 and was hopeful  but what i ended up doing was buying a used acoustic b20 1x12 bass combo amp for the same price as this new practice amp and i am a lot more satisfied  again  this review is strictly on the aspect of a bass guitar  not regular guitar 
great price but unfortunately this product didn t work for me  fortunately i had no problem returning it for a full refund so overall i m happy with the results 
this works in some applications  but doesn t work in many others  even when detected by the software  it will not work with line 6 equipment  too bad  because it would have been convenient to program my effects with my laptop instead of my desktop 
i don t know how this will work with other midi instruments but i tried it with the roland td9 drums and although it does transmit the data  the drum map is totally off  the respective triggers  hihat  hihat pedal  etc  are translated into all sorts of wrong information and while you can manually compensate for some of it on the pc end of it  it was just a freaking hassle  i needed this to be more flexible and able to record directly to my notebook  which doesn t have a midi input  but i gave up in the end and went with my desktop pc and its midi interface 
my advice  spend more and get something that will work with all applications   cheap midi may get you there  but if not you have to buy another   yep  always the gamble 
i may have misunderstood the product description but i prefer the string tied to the end of my acoustic over this  my issue is that it makes my guitar really high up when i play in a standing position and there is no way to adjust the strap the make it longer  if you play sitting down a lot then this would probably work for you  don t get me wrong  there was nothing wrong with the product itself  it just wasn t what i thought 
purchased it to use on a 00 28 slotted headstock martin and it just didn t fit well for me  also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove  a string style worked a lot better  was a lot easier to attach and remove  and provided a lot more options for where it good be placed 
i like the jim dunlop  60mm pitch black guitar picks best   if you want your electric guitar to sound like eddie van halen  joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound  then get a boss gt 10  guitar multi effects processor  and install boss gt 10 patches by james limborg   search google for boss gt 10 patches by james limborg 
these cables are excellent quality cables  however  if you are trying to patch your pedals together in a closely spaced setup  these cables are rather bulky and stiff the large size of the right angle connectors requires you to space your pedals out more than you might prefer  especially compared to some of the other pedal patch cables that are available from companies such as hosa 
i purchased the h4n after being unhappy with the h2 s performance most significant where i couldn t record a good sounding signal that wasn t distorted with the line in jack   only to find that the h4n has the same problem but not as bad   if i try to record a line level signal from a sound board or stereo receiver and connect to the h4n s 1 4 inch jacks  it is almost impossible to not to have a distorted signal   it appears that on both models the line in preamp is too sensitive and clips very easily and because it is clipping in the preamp  adjusting the gain doesn t correct it   i contacted zoom s tech support about the h2 and was told that i likely had a defective unit   i returned the h2 and decided to give zoom another chance and try the h4n after seeing many positive reviews i really like the h4n s design  the menus and controls are nicely organized   it feels more sturdy than the h2   the recording quality using the built in mics is excellent   most other recorders in this price range don t have xlr inputs   since i plan to use it mostly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape out on a sound board  if the line in jacks don t work properly and can t accept a normal line level signal without clipping  i can t use this for what i bought it for   i have used my sony minidisc recorder for the same type of application for the past 8 years and have never had any problems   i ve worked with pro sound equipment for over 25 years and have used many types of recorders and so far the zoom products are the only ones where i have encountered this problem   if you are using this to record with mics  it works great  but if you need to record from line level sources  the zoom recorders may not be a good choice   i exchanged this for the tascam dr 07 and while the tascam doesn t have as many bells and whistles  it is a nice recorder and i m very happy with it 
i really wanted this to be a great product   the screws strip out too easily   basically  if you put a microphone in it  and ever have to use it for a microphone  it is going to strip out   i had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon   nope   even the pop filter fell off   i love the design  but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage    ex   adjusting the position of the mic  picking up a mic stand and moving it  etc   otherwise  don t have an adjustable tilt option   just make it one solid piece   i m tempted to try to fix it with gorilla glue because i do love the design   it s just not strong enough   not that it s a surprise though   not much of anything is worth the money these days   it s a damn chore to return every friggin  purchase these days that they don t really have to care about actually testing products   why should they   they already have your money   i feel like i should get paid for testing their products and the time spent un boxing and packing things back up   besides  what are they going to do   replace it with another broke a$$ product   better yet  refund my money for the product i paid   minus shipping      that doesn t include the time i spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place   i want a refund  plus an hourly wage   whatever  don t buy one   companies that don t test their products don t deserve your business   what would make me happy  is for one of these companies that make these products to answer the question s    did you test this product   how did you test it   what were your results   is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence nope
i gave it two stars because the expression pedal stopped working after the second day   and visually it s hard to read because the lettering is so small  also there are  many function for one knob to have  a little confusion for me  the sounds are great and the recording aspect of it is nice  but not something that is best for my needs i am looking into a boss me 25 instead 
i only bought with the idea that a "full" version of behringer s sequence program came with it    needless to says its a "compact version" and for you other imac os x users out there        aint worth yer timeyer better off spending your money on vst s au s that will work with osx and cubase or garageband    other than that its another interface "i guess" as long as you want to use rca plugs to do that with   who the  $%^ uses rca to interface there analog instruments to their puter    based on the software hustle im sorta sour but if yer a pc windows owner i would get it    its about the cheapest way to "intro" yer way in to daw dat interface      mainly im talkning to katz who ownnewer macs imacs who are truying to muddle your way thru music digital interface and keyboard sequencingfor those users yer better off buying a pizza probably   
i have a 1953 telecaster body and after installing the screw to the pickup they were to long for the body   i had to trim them down
this particular brand i ve seen around and haven t heard to much about them  but the one that i got worked fine for about a couple days  it went out and i sent it in hoping to rule out the possibility that i might have gotten a bad one and i requested in a letter when i sent it in that they send another one in exchange  that didn t work out so well  with that being the only way i could rate it and never receiving a replacement to verify that i just got a bad one  i d have to rate this one at the bottom   
should have paid a little more and i guess im spoiled with 2nd day   these have been ordered for a couple of weeks   you seem to wait forever to save a few bucks   i odered for some buddies and hear about it every day   hope they work when they do finally arrive  good luck
sounds disgusting  very bright and clear highs  nothing beautiful in mids and totally muddy lows  don t hope to take chords on it  only on first 4 strings may be   try out fender s mini amp if you re searching for a little thing  or but a bigger one 
ok  i m surprised that this unit is now over $15 00   i only spent $8 59 for this and i m mad at myself   it was cheap enough that i rolled the dice to see if i could get away with a decent product for cheap   it feels solid  looks like a real direct box   but sounds like ass   i couldn t believe that pyle would put that much effort into a great "fit and finish" product  yet not put decent components inside   this is the noisiest piece of crap i ve ever used   i ended up buying another direct box  spent over $60 00    pyle has once again lived up to it s name  but they should finish the name properly and re brand as "pyle of s    "sorry folks  but i d skip this one   the 5 star ratings must be from employees   the only reason i didnt  give it one star was because it was so cheap  remember  i only spent $8 59   and i m the one that pulled the trigger on the purchase live and learn   why would i think plugging a $2000 00 guitar into a cheap piece of crap was a good idea   my fault 
well 3 hours to put together got tiring and annoying as things tend to fall a part  however as a standalone items it is great with good sounds and groove tracks to practice drumming on  however i am not a drummer nor have any interest in becoming one  i bought this in order to use with software recording for basic beats to fit my own songs  and it is a nightmaregoing on a week now no support help from either company  heed my warning if you want to use this with ni  ez drummer or other programs like that you must know how to reroute mapping of midi in order to use it  this is not a plug and play item you will spend hours of your time trying to get this to work with software   there is very little helpful info out on the net i ve owned this for over a week and still never used it for its purpose yet being that its a stand alone item  there really is no midi support  im am close to giving up the fight and sending it back alesis could have made this an amazing item and 1000 times easier if they simply created a midi out port on the module you could run into your daw and software  
it does not stick on to the guitar very well   trying some of the other reviews as to ways to get it to stick worked but i now have a small circle in the finish of my martin   i made mistake of attaching so wife could play rocksmith and now wish i had used cheaper guitar or better yet  bought a better pickup 
the suction cup does not work  it looks like aged  it s very hard with room temp 70f  i removed the rubber suction cup and i have to use a big paper clipper to secure it on the sound hole edge  it picks up sound ok  but not great 
i bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic  learned my lesson  should of just forked over the money for an a e  i have a yamaha f335 i really like  i say someone take a piezo transducer to amplify his guitar so i thought i d try it  i first picked up a transducer for about $3 and experimented  i like it  sounded good then i saw this from axl and i thought i d try it  installing it wasn t bad except i bought a set of drill bits i didn t need for $10  so i got it installed and plugged it in and from the start the sound was alright  i just wanted it for playing around at home so i didn t need real great sound quality  but sound was ok except it picks up every bang and knock especially my planet waves i think quick connect strap connector  my other complaint is i couldn t turn it up too loud without the feedback screeching  overall product quality is good  setup was ok  price was good  sound in my opinion needs some tweaking 
the fact that it is passive really kills it  i just could not get any sound out of it  i tried multiple placements  i finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it  not worth the money  or the extra hole in your guitar 
this is a hit or miss product   for me it fell short but for others it seems to work very well   it s not a total loss since i can reuse the endpin jack with the soundhole solution i ended up with   it was cheap enough that it was worth taking a chance on 
i ve been using primarily alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spending so much for them  i figured i d try some others at half the price and see if any stack up these were the first to go on  and they were a huge step down from what i had on  the strings i took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high e string  they were twice as loud as these  when you take these out of the pack  they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti  they don t do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do  the cons definitely outweigh the pros here pros  very flexible  string bends are easy easy on the fingerscons  the most dull sound of any strings i ve ever heard  especially on the low end  they re dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound  the highs are very tinny  almost sounds like a bad recording  your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings  it s the weirdest thing  this is especially true for the g string  it s hard to explain  but it s kind of like rubbing against something really clean  where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and there s tons of squeak to boot  anyways  it sucks  grip is the last thing you want on your strings bottom line  unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to bend strings  these should not be purchased  i ll never buy again  this is the first time in my life i wanted to change brand new strings 
if you ve never had a pedalboard before i d say pass on this one and look for one that is more user friendly   the pics and description don t show just how insanely large this is   it s too big   patch cables are crap and the power supply didn t seem sturdy enough to be kicked around besides this  i had trouble using it  even for practice  because the lip of the case gets in the way of my foot hitting the pedals i ended up giving this one away to a friend and getting a gator  bone  and a seperate power supply   easier to practice with and easier to toss into another case with mics cables rather than being a whole suitcase on it s own 
i bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps  if you want the metal sound for practice  then it is hard to get a better amp for one bill  but with the hybrid amps  vibro champ  going for not much more  you get better sounds and more settings  i am selling mine and ordered a super champ xd used in new condition for two and a half bills  this line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding  from now on its tube amps for me  even if i have to pay the price  a good tube amp should last a long time and hold its value well  too  like i said  for a first amp at one bill  the line 6 isnt too bad  maybe some day i will be able to afford a princeton reverb 
before i purchased the fbv i scoured the web to see how it works with the pod hd desktop  and even the advanced users guide leaves you thinking  anyway  i lucked out and found a used one going cheap  and after some time figured out exactly what you can and cannot do with the pod hd desktop & fbv express ii combo 1  first  in the setup screen do not enable the fbv express  yes  i know this sounds dumb  but internet scouring shows there is a bug that this is a workaround for   2  read the fbv express users guide and calibrate the pedal   there is no need to d l the fbv software for this now   in the pod setup screens you have the option to either have the abcd buttons as abcd  or to be fs5 fs8  this behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the fbv so   in abcd mode you can a  select preset a  b  c or d from the group you are currently in b  insert a volume fx and use volume pedal   exp2c  insert another fx enabled by toe switch  and controlled by pedal as exp1d  tap temp  by tapping the currently selected preset  ie the pedal that is lit e  enable the tuner  press hold the current selected preset pedal f  you have some basic control of the looper  but cannot enable it 3 10 14 edit  looper control is flawed  you can record and go to overdub  but you cannot record then play stop the loop   you can stop from overdub but not start the loop  seemingly an acknowledged and unfixed bugnice enough  but if you are like me  switching presets is way way less useful than switching fx blocks on & off  incidentally you can combine blocks such that one pedal  say  turns od on  and delay & chorus both off  or turn one amp on and one off  channel switching    yay   you cry  that sounds like me so its a no to abcd and mode fs5 fs8 it is for me   so yup in fs5 8 mode you can do that  you cana  enable disable 4 sets of block s  using the four pedalsb  use volume and expression options as above  ie like volume or wah  overdrive level  delay fb etc c  basic control of looper but cannot enable itedit 3 19 14 looper control flawed as stated abovec  enable the tuner    oh sod it  nope you can td  tap tempo    nope not that either so in summary  the express is better than nothing  but certainly does not provide hands free operation of the desktop   the shortboard is worth the extra  or if you are reading this before buying the pod   get the hd500x instead 
not so pleased with this  the seller is fine  no prob  there  its that this mic for my use is useless  it records tooo low  cant get enough volume from it
bought for my son to do game capture voice overs  the first day it was fine  if a bit sensitive  by the third day it was broken  cheap to buy  but cheaply made 
the technology is fine but the attachment to the instrument isn t very friendly  snark rotates to any position i want  but intellitouch ends up being upside down  it works fine but it s inconvenient 
bought this rosin to see how i would like it   i have a very light hand on the bow  so i like a rosin that is on the aggressive side   this is not   since all fiddlers have their own styles you have to deal with trial & error 
this does work as described   it arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out   the reason i only gave it two stars however is because i find it so uncomfortable   its quite hard on your collarbone   i have added foam to it and now it works well  but i suspect one might be better just buying a foam one in the first place 
this pedal is ok at best there are a lot better metal pedals out there the only thing this one really has going for it is it has a built in noise gate other wise this pedal is pretty thin sounding and has far to much gain then you will ever need  i would personally recommend the electro harmonix metal muff over this any day it is a better sounding pedal for about the same price 
it is entry level but only records one channel even though it is misleading with multiple inputs and outputs  it works as a beginner tool but only that  mono only 
this was my first foray into home recording  and it comes with audacityfor free   free is free  and you get what you pay for in terms of something that will not produce high qualty musical reproduction    the interface is noisy  and it requred a lot of tweaking after the fact to get a reasonable sound without distorion and humms etc   sent it back after one day 
im starting a podcast  i blindly lept to buy the blue yeti  i can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this  great for voice overs  in sound proof studios  the sound quality was good but it picked up way to much room noise  the ability to select the 4 recording modes is great  if youll use it  i would not reccomend recording 2 people at once on this  however recording a choir or something would work  but i will never do that and neither will you  this microphone only has a usb port  not xlr  so no hope of expanding  if you ever want to host a podcast with 2 people you need to throw this away and get a mixer and 2 new microphones or you can do what i did and get 2 audio technica atr 2100 s  1 behringer xenyx 802 dual mic input mixer  2 shock mount broadcast boom combos and 2 windscreens for the same price as a yeti  raidus shock mount  the pop pop filter and a generic mic stand now i can replace my mixer and keep my 2 mics  or replace the mics then the mixer and do all sorts of expansions and add ons as well as get quality audio for 2 hosts on my podcast do not get this yeti unless your doing youtube voiceovers by yourself forever
i normally tune to drop f on my 8 string  but even in standard  i just cant stand the strobe  and theres no other mode  i ordered a pitch black for $70  im still waiting on the return for this 
i ordered these stands hoping that they would be better than the price indicated  however  the bag was ripped in 3 places  the stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing  the most annoying thing was that they did not match each other  the locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights  the holes in the inner poles were drilled  in different places so in order to use the support pins and have the speakers at the same height  you had to adjust the legs to accommodate the difference in height  they looked like they might be relatively solid but i returned them anyway   bit disappointing 
both of the stands had parts that had fallen out  or were missing all together  when the pamphlet that comes with them states that they are fully assembled and guaranteed to be free of defects  this is a major concern  it may be that i got a bad box that got missed by quality control  but it does make me suspicious of pyle products 
i bought these just to add a layer of sound in my blues tunes i record  the notes don t bend easily   if you think your will cheat the big boys harps  youll be dissapointed quickly   these are little more than toys compared to $40 dollar harps  they feel cheap but have a decent sound    i dont know if they will last  but to make harp noises without decent bends     ill use these sparingly   jim
the picks work well with bass  but they are just too thick to use with ukulele  the pics also shed easily  making your instrument dusty in no time 
i guess the tension on these is more than my uke was used to and when i put them on the neck became severely bowed after a day or two  sounded lovely for the first hour  that s why two stars  granted my uke is one of the cheaper lanikais  if you have a better built uke it might be able to take these but i simply can t recommend personally 
for any usable tones while playing live  the best bet is to plug it into a tube power amp  direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring i didn t like the recorded tones either  much rather preferred amplitube 3 if micing a real tube amp wasn t an option that being said  it is good for practice and song writing  used this for more than a year and finally sold it  that s the other thing with items like this  they lose value real quick once the next version comes out 
i bought an ibanez concert size uke   the body is 2 inches wide  less than the 2 75 inches stated for this stand    my uke does not fit well in the stand   why   the twin forks at the base that hold the instrument are both too narrow  and the curve downward from the stand is not proper for this uke   thus  any uke that is concert size or greater   so  most ukes don t fit well   they fit  just not well i did  and you will likely need this advice  remove the bottom fork  turn it upside down  and reinstall it  no tools required    now the "curve" of it is upward  and the uke better sits on it   the fit is improved   not great but better   one stand can t fit all instruments  but my full size guitar stands hold most all guitars   this small stand does not hold most all ukes although its neat how it folds up  like the video here on amazon reviews  it is very heavy for its size   this is not a lightweight stand   at all   surprisingly heavy  and not one that you will be lugging around day to day in your uke gig bag  trust me i wish i got the hercules standhercules gs402b mini stand  all hercules stuff is superb  and my friend has one for his uke and says it s sublime  i don t own it  myself  so i just present this so you can research it and it s reviews on amazon   i own other herc stuff  and it s all ideal  and for a few bucks more  i could have had that lifelong use stand instead of this one   oh  well  for once  i got cheap   and got burned for it all in all  not great  this tiny stand   one stand fits not all   perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand  but i think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments   you may think you can bend the lower forks  but it s hard to do  will require a vice  and if you see on the amazon pictures  the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves  so if you splay it out like it should be  you ll change the way it fits in the grooves  and thus it won t work at all   it s just an imperfect design  my take on it  your mileage may vary   bye bye 
let me first start off with the sizing  when they say "fits soundholes from 33 75"   35""  they really mean it you are going to have a hard time trying to fit it even if it is 1 16" smaller than the specifications i know i did  my friend s oscar schmidt 3 4 sized guitar was just that much smaller and it did not fit well  the edges did not "catch" completely  and it looks terrible my classical guitar had a similarly sized soundhole but because of the much wider fretboard at the edge of the soundhole  it did not fit at all  you could try cutting the edges off the oport at the fretboard the main issue is the sound yes  it does make the sound fuller when you are strumming  slightly but enough to tell however  it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes fingerpicking just does not sound as nice as before  even though the guitar is noticeably better on the bass notes for me  that does not justify it a simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less another thing i found out was what was amazon does to stuff others return   they resell as brand new if it looks brand new the packaging on mine came slightly torn and looked as if it had been opened  does it matter  in practical terms  no  not for this sort of item i guess that is how amazon keeps their prices low yet with good customer service and return policies 
perhaps it may do something of worth for you but if you have one of the finer made guitars this will probably do more to subtract than add to the sound  be advised that i did not use it in front of a microphone where perhaps the shape of this internal plastic cone might do something you like in directing the sound to a mike  as strictly an issue of natural acoustics  i found it deflected sound in a way that seemed to decrease my guitar s output and resonance  i have an aria ad 80 which is a very well made chinese attempt at cloning a martin d 42  it can not compete with the real martin but for the money i paid it was a great buy and it is known as a "sound canon" for it s great natural volume  adding the o port deadened the lows  it just didn t provide any plus at all anywhere else  it is however pretty inexpensive so if you re a nut for nuance and you want to try it for yourself it s not going to break your bank  but again  if you have one of the better makes of guitar where a real person "voiced it" in his or her manufacturing process  this plastic gizmo will likely subtract from that and not add anything  i m an acoustic nut and i d love to have a sound port in the side of my guitar to hear everything that goes on inside that box  the o port seemed to "corral" the sound and shoot it out that plastic horn not allowing me to hear some of the resonance of the sound bouncing back off the back and sides below the sound hole  sorry to be a crab about it  i like planet waves stuff and they were very good to me personally in the "humidipak" recall a few years back  but this product was a waste to me 
i thought it would protect my desk but the pad is almost like that rubber they put under rugs so they won t slip around  maybe i should get that for cheaper i accidently bought large  ooh boy is it  like  windshield sun reflector size  sort of just a personal opinion review i suppose 
first time i tried to use it  it broke in my hand   it is now taped together  while i wait for a different kind to replace it 
tuner works great  both by vibration and mic only real problem is the fact that the joint between the tuner and the clip is really weak  mine broke off    not even a year old 
stopped working all by itself  fresh battery didn t help fortunately  i ve another  plus a korg and an two intellitouch   i ve 2 fiddles and 3 guitars the intellitouch is simply "champion " 
no matter how many times i hard reset my 3gs  no success  there is no problem with my jack  and the phone is in pristine condition    no problems until now  there is definitely a connection and communication because the mic and sample track work  but that s about it  i registered my amplitude app  and followed all of the instructions on the box  i tested the irig with an iphone 4 and was able to get it operating i am giving this two stars because it did work on my friend s iphone 4  but for my purposes with a 3gs  it is a brick  if anyone has any suggestions that lead to successful operation  i will re rate the product 
this is a pretty decent thing for practicing your guitar through your iphone or ipad  but if you want to use it for any recording at all  even demos  i strongly recommend going for the irighd  the hd sounds waaaaaay better  and the build quality is great  this guy  not so much  there was always a bit of noise with my old irig  and it seemed to get worse over time  it also felt kinda fragile and chinsy  if you look  you can usually find the hd somewhere for $80  a $50 difference is significant  but the jump in quality  and likely longevity of the product  is definitely worth it  i upgraded and would absolutely do it again 
bought this for a friend  cheap plastic enclosure  affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay  he tried to use it for his cleans for our punk ska band but there was no messing with the controls to get a suitable delay  stay away from this one and get a better used pedal 
could be a fluke  but my unit was defective straight out of the box   plugged it into the macbook pro  fired up garageband and right away it s midi connectivity was intermittent  then it had some stuck notes   then it stopped being recognized at all   it still got power from the usb bus  but no midi  no sound   the jack was visibly wiggly  too so  you re mileage may vary  but mine obviously had a defective usb port on the back   rather than bust it open and get soldering iron  i returned it and bought an m audio oxygen 25 for $20 more 
with drum pads  i basically either get 0 velocity  or max   and i have to really hammer on them to trigger   hurts after a while likes + size+ assignable knobs + works good w  ableton livedislikes   drum pads keys are pretty cheesy but workable and expected for this price and size i m looking to upgrade after a month   want better drum pads      
i honestly was not impressed  it looked cheap  sounded cheap  what else is there to say  you get what you pay for    another chinese copy of a tubescreamer 
i can t say much about this product   i tried it twice   it seemed like it kind of cleaned the strings  but i really didn t notice any great change   the strings didn t sound betteer or brighter   now  it sits in my drawer and collects dust   maybe i will try it again at some point  but    
tc is very overrated many pedals i have out performs this in my opinion   the vintage bbds  mxr vintage delay  morley 70 s echo  for example just take it   but for newer pedals i liked the mxr carbon copy and ibanex de 7 much better 
it is ok as long as you don t bump your guitar  else boom  it hits the floor   i don t trust it and amazon has it way over priced   it will work if you put a nail in it to hold the holder in place 
i purchased this instrument brand new  on an impulse whim due to a managers choice sale at a local music shop that i simply could not ignore   it was brand new  unopened  in box   they allowed me to examine it prior to purchase  in that environment i thought it a nice instrument however  it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store  and that store was very busy and noisy   it s when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out this is indeed a 6 string ukulele   it measures a bit over 28" top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke   i have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range   the advantage to this of course is it s 6 string  so if you re a guitar player you can achieve the ukulele sound and portability without learning totally new fingering     that is of course  until you realize that while it has 6 strings  it is not tuned like a guitar   it s tuned to adgcea rather than eadgbe   one cannot simply play guitar music on this instrument  all such music has to be transposed or new chord name recognition learned   being a total newbie to ukes  this was news to me until i got it home and read the instructions   so my primary purpose in purchasing this   to have a small portable guitar  hit a snag now that s not totally the end of the thing  because you can be a little inventive and use alternate string sizes to tune this to standard guitar tuning   it takes a bit of experimentation but it is possible to set this up to standard guitar tuning if one doesn t mind buying a couple of string sets and playing mixup   so all is not lost there   it was just an unexpected surprise   mainly because i didn t research the instrument prior to purchase  it s rare that i impulse buy  so tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument   that s where the yamaha really falls short   this is an oil rather than a lacquer or shellac finish and in several places the oil was still visible and could be wiped away by hand   there were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box   that this was a "rush job" out of a factory with no finish work at all was blatantly obvious there are no strap pegs  those will require being added by hand  not difficult  but extra expense and time  the action is of course too high   that s not unusual   in truth it s quite common in off the shelf stringed instruments and came as no surprise   but along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here however  the thing that bothers me the most   if i wasn t aware this is a yamaha guitalele    i d think it s was a cheap knock off child s guitar   there s not one thing about this instrument that says "quality"   which is quite disappointing   this instrument sells for about $100   that low cost is obvious   this is a "cheap guitar" in every way   i can t honestly say it s a toy  but it reeks "beginner instrument"   the tuners are as cheap as they come   the finish is cheap  there is no decoration  no protective edging  the finish is   unfinished i bought this solely based on the number of positive reviews here on amazon   and i respect those reviews   people have different tastes and for some folks this has a "home made" feel that they will love   however i ve been playing guitar for  mumblety mumble  deca   uh    years and i know the difference between quaint and cheap   i own two ovation guitars  a peavey electric bass  a hand made violin and an epiphone electric uke  which is of such higher quality it s not even a contest  and no i m not hawking epiphone   facts is facts  that s all   you can read my very positive review on the epiphone on amazon  when i got this  home and took a good look at it  i found no sign of quality or craftsmanship  nothing that said anything more than "this was made as cheaply and quickly as humanly possible"   in truth the only positive thing i have to say about it is that it does have a spruce top and the strings are of reasonably decent quality other than those two factors  one can find $40 $50 full size guitars all over amazon that equal or surpass this instrument in quality   the only benefit this would offer is its smaller size and ukulele voice   if someone particularly wants an inexpensive portable guitar tuned like a uke   other than its portability  i find no special merit in this and even at its relatively low price    consider it over priced  or rather  under made  one must grant it s largely a matter of personal taste and expectation   but low quality is low quality  edit two weeks later   i just today saw the cordoba at a local store   a direct competition to this instrument   the cordoba is much nicer   it s built better  has better sound  and is finished out much more nicely   sorry yamaha  but facts is facts   had i seen the cordoba and yamaha side by side  i d have bought and kept the cordoba  that s my honest review   i know some will disagree   but others know exactly what i mean   this isn t an expensive instrument so one really can t expect super fine quality at this price  however   i paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom   as mentioned  the cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and i was able to return it   i simply cannot recommend this instrument unless there are no better options   and frankly  there are 
i ordered one of these  from mf  and had to send it back because it was damaged and the latches didn t all work   even in perfect condition it s still a subpar case   but the one i got had two ripped corners on the lid  and from those rips it s easy to see that the edge of the lid is just very thin cardboard all around  and the black outside covering provides little protection to keep that cardboard from tearing   as for the latches  buckles   there are three of them and on the one i had only one worked to keep the case closed   the other two latched  but they rattled and provided no tension at all to help keep the lid shut disregarding those flaws it s still obvious that it s not a good case   the hinges look like they could fall apart or come off at any moment  the handle is not comfortable to hold  and the whole thing bends in a way that makes you wonder if you would be better off with a gig bag   it also won t stand evenly on end  if that s important to you  on the positive side it s light  it does fit a telecaster ok  and the inside is a decent plush lining with a small storage compartment   but do yourself a favor and spend another $25 and get something better   i have a musician s gear dreadnought case and this doesn t compare to that one at all 
i was dissapointed to find out that you can only use one of theeffects at a time  good though they were  too expensive foronly one effect at a time  returned it 
it is built like a tank  but it quit working after a couple of weeks  i haven t made time trouble shoot it yet  so i m not sure what component has failed 
this is more of a toy than a good pickup  it functions but doesn t sound great  what did i want for this price anyway 
first we have to realize this is not a $200 pickup or even a $50 pickup   it s less than ten bucks it has a specially designed clamp that is good for attaching it to the sound hole of a guitar   as such it is not going to work for an instrument without a considerable size sound hole   it also will tend to get in the way of those who play directly over the sound hole  as it is quite easy to hit and will pick up any contact noise it is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices   unless you run it directly into the amp within a distance of 8 ft you are also going to need a 1 4" to 1 4" coupler  to allow it to connect to an extension guitar cord    you will need such extension as this tends to have significant feedback issues if the amp is too close or facing the guitar it is a passive pickup  so you will need either an amp with a passive specific input or a preamp mixer or other preamp device  if you don t have a preamp system  this will do you no good so because of the limitations i rate it as above   for what it does though   providing a passive pickup that can be quickly switched out between instruments  it does okay   i believe there are better pickup concepts out there for about the same amount of money  including adhesive disk mikes   i would prefer to permanently mount a pickup of some kind and there are many low cost pickups out there to choose from   but this is a slightly different concept  removable  that for the price is worth checking in to 
i bought this to use on my fender p bass  it is not reliable for me  sometimes it works and sometimes it can t find the low note correctly  i m still using my roland stomp box tuner  glad this was inexpensive  it was not worth the hassle to return  i gave it away 
there is almost no difference between this and the snark sn 1  and by that i mean the design flaws  you have to constantly adjust the neck to get a reading  and they eat batteries like crazy  the snark sn 8 is far superior 
this gadget works fine to connect an electric guitar to an ipad or iphone or a computer  but the particular one i received has a defective input socket for a 1 4 inch audio plug   it doesn t snap in place   just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out   that makes it fairly useless   i may have simply gotten a defective one 
i tried this in front  in the middle  and at the end of an effects chain  as well as by itself  plugged into the effects loop of my mesa boogie mark v amplifier   whenever it is in the path  as soon as i engage my effects loop  the signal level drops considerably   it did not matter whether the pedal was on or not   the chorus effect is good  but i don t want my volume to drop every time i turn on my effects loop   i have the loop balanced with all of the other pedals that i use  so i can t raise the send any more 
this cable was very affordable  but you get what you pay for  it sounded brilliant while it wasn t broken  for about the 4 hours of runtime  it works if it isn t abused at all  but if you abuse it in any way at all  your out an xlr cable  i do not recommend this product at all for heavy usage 
well    its a stand    its super cheap and i don t mean the price   the edges are sharp and the piece that holds the neck of the guitars is leaning too far back   i stuck some cardboard under the rear post to help keep that back brace more up right and no leaning back   its going to work but i bumped the bottom with my bare feet and it cut me pretty well   instructions were ok    came with more parts than what were required    all holes filled and i have  of of each part extra   the guitars do not sit very well in this stand    i will use it until i can find a better one   it will get replaced   i really should send this pos back to amazon   the concept is great but the execution of it sucks  it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand    there are better options out there for something portable   this stand is worth 10 00 tops    if i had it to do all over i would save my money
